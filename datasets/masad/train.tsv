14546462480	negative	14546462480.jpg	alcedo atthis , the common kingfisher also known as eurasian kingfisher , or river kingfisher , is a small kingfisher with seven subspecies recognized within its wide distribution across eurasia and north africa . it is resident in much of its range , but migrates from areas where rivers freeze in winter . this sparrow sized bird has the typical short tailed , large headed kingfisher profile it has blue upper parts , orange underparts and a long bill . it feeds mainly on fish , caught by diving , and has special visual adaptations to enable it to see prey under water . the glossy white eggs are laid in a nest at the end of a burrow in a riverbank . this species was first described by carl linnaeus in his systema naturae in 1758 as gracula atthis . the modern binomial name derives from the latin alcedo , quot kingfisher quot from greek word halcyon ( a mythical bird said by ancient writers to breed in a nest floating at sea at the winter solstice , charming the wind and waves into calm ) and atthis ( a beautiful young woman of lesbos , and favourite of sappho ) . the genus alcedo comprises a number of small , exclusively fish eating kingfishers . the common kingfisher s closest relatives in the genus are three similar blue backed , orange breasted species , the blue eared , half collared and blyth 's kingfishers . this beautiful mature specimen sadly met it 's end ( gender unknown ) , when it collided with a neighbour 's window . it had been known that a pair had taken to hunting along a nearby chalk stream , in which small eels and fish had established themselves after a particularly wet spring . all copyright reserved 2014 art hutchins a href http www . artseye . me rel nofollow www . artseye . me a	bird

4608537903	negative	4608537903.jpg	true story . . . i was walking the bear and i saw two birds fly out of a tree . this bird literally rolled over 2 or 3 times and stayed like this . he did n't it again about 1 minute later and then i walked over to him to see if he was really dead . the other bird stood watch for a while and waited , almost as if he wanted to make sure this dude was gone . he was still breathing and looking around with his eyes when i took this . i kept willing him to get up and fight the other bird , but he would n't . damn animal kingdom ! ca n't we all just get along ?	bird

7987556042	negative	7987556042.jpg	it s kind of strange . i had been in this room once before , and sat maybe three feet away from this very bird i photographed , yet had no idea he ( or she , but for all intensive purposes we ll go with he ) was even there . then , on a return trip two months later , i found myself in the room once again and noticed this little guy . over the course of editing this photo , i ve learned more and more about him and it really kind of took me by surprise . through bringing out the detail of the photograph , i brought out the detail of the last 72 ( give or take ) hours of his life . now i m no scientist or mortician , but the educated guesses i have come up with are he broke his back . most likely from flying around in the pitch black that this building becomes at night . my guess is he got trapped during the day , and was still frantically attempting to escape by the time night fell . he was not trapped long . the area that his remaining , mummified abdominal encasing engulfs is too plump to reflect starvation . he felt it . he was likely mid flight ( as mentioned before ) . parts of his upper wing are broken and his eyes are closed . unless he was in the middle of blinking , it s safe to assume a bird isn t going to be flying with his eyes closed . even in the pitch black . so he probably closed his eyes immediately at impact , once he felt what was happening . also , not pictured , his toes were curled . he braced for impact . what i ve learned from the photo aside , i especially loved how mr . bird here took me by surprise but i chose to bring him out in the photograph instead , so people can appreciate his presence instead of scrolling past and dismissing him as just another pile of asbestos ( like i initially did ) . i also loved how he really looks like he just fell asleep . that s what i thought originally , and that s how it really looks . like he curled up all by himself and rested his little head down and just fell asleep . those two aspects are what made me come up with the titles i chose . he fell asleep and has now become almost camouflaged , almost to never again make a peep . but i changed that a little bit , so this image will forever remain as his legacy is carted away with the rest of our beloved harlem . i guess you could say that s part of the reason i love photographing these buildings as much as i do . they ve gone to sleep and each stage they enter is like a stage of life and with each stage of life and death ( literal and figurative ) , every thing speaks . and as every stage passes , there s another message they keep the same messages i try to capture with my photography . to see the second installment of this picture series , proceed to a href http www . flickr . com photos kiddinz 7987547531 in photostream www . flickr . com photos kiddinz 7987547531 in photostream a	bird

5577515383	negative	5577515383.jpg	subject where to go during an earthquake this is the text version of my earlier email styled save your life with quot the triangle of life quot ( see below ) further elucidating on the life saving concept of quot the triangle of life quot . . . . folks , please share , share , share this with your loved ones where to go during an earthquake remember that stuff about hiding under a table or standing in a doorway ? well , forget it ! this is a real eye opener . it could save your life someday . extract from doug copp's article on 'the triangle of life' my name is doug copp . i am the rescue chief and disaster manager of the american rescue team international ( arti ) , the world 's most experienced rescue team . the information in this article will save lives in an earthquake . i have crawled inside 875 collapsed buildings , worked with rescue teams from 60 countries , founded rescue teams in several countries , and i am a member of many rescue teams from many countries . i was the united nations expert in disaster mitigation for two years , and have worked at every major disaster in the world since 1985 , except for simultaneous disasters . the first building i ever crawled inside of was a school in mexico city during the 1985 earthquake . every child was under its desk . every child was crushed to the thickness of their bones . they could have survived by lying down next to their desks in the aisles . it was obscene unnecessary . simply stated , when buildings collapse , the weight of the ceilings falling upon the objects or furniture inside crushes these objects , leaving a space or void next to them not under them . this space is what i call the 'triangle of life' . the larger the object , the stronger , the less it will compact . the less the object compacts , the larger the void , the greater the probability that the person who is using this void for safety will not be injured . the next time you watch collapsed buildings , on television , count the 'triangles' you see formed . they are everywhere . it is the most common shape , you will see , in a collapsed building . tips for earthquake safety 1 ) most everyone who simply 'ducks and covers' when building collapse are crushed to death . people who get under objects , like desks or cars , are crushed . 2 ) cats , dogs and babies often naturally curl up in the fetal position . you should too in an earthquake . it is a natural safety survival instinct . you can survive in a smaller void . get next to an object , next to a sofa , next to a bed , next to a large bulky object that will compress slightly but leave a void next to it . 3 ) wooden buildings are the safest type of construction to be in during an earthquake . wood is flexible and moves with the force of the earthquake . if the wooden building does collapse , large survival voids are created . also , the wooden building has less concentrated , crushing weight . brick buildings will break into individual bricks . bricks will cause many injuries but less squashed bodies than concrete slabs . 4 ) if you are in bed during the night and an earthquake occurs , simply roll off the bed . a safe void will exist around the bed . hotels can achieve a much greater survival rate in earthquakes , simply by posting a sign on the back of the door of every room telling occupants to lie down on the floor , next to the bottom of the bed during an earthquake . 5 ) if an earthquake happens and you cannot easily escape by getting out the door or window , then lie down and curl up in the fetal position next to a sofa , or large chair . 6 ) most everyone who gets under a doorway when buildings collapse is killed . how ? if you stand under a doorway and the doorjamb falls forward or backward you will be crushed by the ceiling above . if the door jam falls sideways you will be cut in half by the doorway . in either case , you will be killed ! 7 ) never go to the stairs . the stairs have a different 'moment of frequency' ( they swing separately from the main part of the building ) . the stairs and remainder of the building continuously bump into each other until structural failure of the stairs takes place . the people who get on stairs before they fail are chopped up by the stair treads horribly mutilated . even if the building does n't collapse , stay away from the stairs . the stairs are a likely part of the building to be damaged . even if the stairs are not collapsed by the earthquake , they may collapse later when overloaded by fleeing people . they should always be checked for safety , even when the rest of the building is not damaged . 8 ) get near the outer walls of buildings or outside of them if possible it is much better to be near the outside of the building rather than the interior . the farther inside you are from the outside perimeter of the building the greater the probability that your escape route will be blocked . 9 ) people inside of their vehicles are crushed when the road above falls in an earthquake and crushes their vehicles which is exactly what happened with the slabs between the decks of the nimitz freeway . the victims of the san francisco earthquake all stayed inside of their vehicles . they were all killed . they could have easily survived by getting out and sitting or lying next to their vehicles . everyone killed would have survived if they had been able to get out of their cars and sit or lie next to them . all the crushed cars had voids 3 feet high next to them , except for the cars that had columns fall directly across them . 10 ) i discovered , while crawling inside of collapsed newspaper offices and other offices with a lot of paper , that paper does not compact . large voids are found surrounding stacks of paper . spread the word and save someone 's life . . . the entire world is experiencing natural calamities so be prepared ! 'we are but angels with one wing , it takes two to fly' in 1996 we made a film , which proved my survival methodology to be correct . the turkish federal government , city of istanbul , university of istanbul case productions and arti cooperated to film this practical , scientific test . we collapsed a school and a home with 20 mannequins inside . ten mannequins did 'duck and cover , ' and ten mannequins i used in my 'triangle of life' survival method . after the simulated earthquake collapse we crawled through the rubble and entered the building to film and document the results . the film , in which i practiced my survival techniques under directly observable , scientific conditions , relevant to building collapse , showed there would have been zero percent survival for those doing duck and cover . there would likely have been 100 percent survivability for people using my method of the 'triangle of life . ' this film has been seen by millions of viewers on television in turkey and the rest of europe , and it was seen in the usa , canada and latin america on the tv program real tv . subject save your life with quot the triangle of life quot quot triangle of life quot without listening or reading , simply by looking at the following self explanatory photos , you can learn more than in a thousand words about how to protect yourself during a major earthquake . . . if you are inside a vehicle , come out and sit or lie down next to it . if something falls on the vehicle , it will leave an empty space along the sides . see below source arti http www . amerrescue . org american rescue team international arti is said to be the world 's most experienced rescue team and disaster management mitigation organization . the information or attachments in this e mail are strictly confidential and are for the intended recipient only . any unauthorized use , dissemination or copying of this message or the information it contains is prohibited . if you are not the intended recipient or you received this by mistake , please notify the sender immediately , and delete the original message and attachments . for more information about philippine airlines , please visit a href http www . philippineairlines . com rel nofollow www . philippineairlines . com a	car
5602237155	negative	5602237155.jpg	i finally made it out to downtown ishinomaki with a friend on april 3rd , 2011 . although we made it out quite late , we were able to help a little by distributing water and food to a few people . although downtown ishinomaki was hit very hard by the tsunami , it was very uplifting to see the progress that had already been made . military supply camps , squads of police , and groups of volunteers were all working tirelessly in restoration . the downtown area seemed to be getting far more attention than any of the other areas i 've visited , but rightfully so , since it has a far higher population density . despite the incredible progress that had been made , there is clearly still a lot to do . the chorus of destroyed boats , cars , and houses again echoed throughout the town . oil logged muck permeated through the hills of debris and toxic smells wafted through the air , but people managed to keep their spirits up regardless . hide quoted text the most somber part of the day for me , was after we left the downtown area and made our way up to hiyoriyama park . i would sometimes come up to hiyoriyama to view the cherry blossoms , watch the sunrise , or relax after archery . every time i went up to the park , i was stunned by the natural beauty and panoramic view of this sprawling city creeping to edge of the ocean . this time , however , i felt as though i was punched in the gut with the starkest realization of utter destruction that i had experienced until this point . the once beautiful view of a thriving city reaching out into the ocean , was replaced with the surreal image of toppled homes and bare foundations . a handful of cars weaving through nearly impassable roads created the only movement in what could easily be confused with a garbage dump or wasteland . i know that eventually the area will be restored , but it will take a lot of work and time to heal the wounds . if you would like to donate to red cross japan , please visit their website here a href http www . jrc . or . jp english relief l4 vcms4 00002070 . html rel nofollow www . jrc . or . jp english relief l4 vcms4 00002070 . html a also , i have decided to donate all of the profits from any of the pictures sold on my website until at least march 11 , 2012 . a href http carstenknoche . com march 25 2011 japan earthquake disaster rel nofollow carstenknoche . com march 25 2011 japan earthquake disaster a lastly , you can read more stories and see more pictures from a variety of different people by purchasing quakebook . all revenue from the book will also be donated to red cross japan . here is their website a href http www . quakebook . org rel nofollow www . quakebook . org a thank you for facing this tragedy with us . carsten knoche	car

16332476081	negative	16332476081.jpg	this is one of my edited photographs from a project entitled quot tea for two quot . i wanted to take pictures of standard tea party set ups but with unusual , questionable dynamics . photographer , tim walker , was a huge inspiration for this project , as still is to me today . his surreal style and extravagant , romantic set ups combined with fairytale motifs seemed perfect for this project . i also looked at traditional food photography in various publications because i wanted to enrouporate a commercial element into this project . however , the idea of photographing a typical set up for a tea party did not seem ground breaking enough . therefore , the unusual style of walker 's work prompted me to arrange and photograph these set ups which cause the audience to ponder as to what sequence of events lead to an outcome of dead flowers , broken china and mouldy or smashed food . i like the irony between a typical tea party set up ( pretty , feminine patterns and colour and vintage china ) and the broken , ruined table seen in the image . ironic twists are something i tend to encorporate in most of my work . as this project developed , i took photographs of more set ups of different pastel colour schemes before moving on to create a roomset of a destroyed tea party . for this roomset , i stained a vintage table cloth , transferred my own photographs of cakes onto plates and pinned dried flowers onto the walls . i also designed my own digital wallpaper a repeat pattern of dried roses which , when printed large scale , looked like a dainty , chintz pattern . the kitsch colour schemes and vintage element to this project is very appealing to me , particularly in contrast with the surreal , unexpected state of the props in these still life 's . in response to the success of this project , i am now working on my own floral digital wallpaper for my bedroom .	flower

4779645567	negative	4779645567.jpg	oof . is this place indicative of the death of the classic parisian bistro ? the restaurant is gorgeous classic paris down to the iced carafe of vouvray and the faded , but marvelous , tilework . the waitress after taking our order , asked if we wanted anything to drink with our meal . and just as i was about to open my mouth and answer to order the wine , she turned and walked out of the room . um , okay . the first course ( above ) was good a soft cooked egg ( 10 ) , asparagus , and pesto with warm toasts . when they brought the main courses , my stuffed chicken breast ( 19 . 90 ) with black trumpet mushrooms was rolled up like tekkamaki , sliced diagonally and upended , and the stuffing ( and likely the chicken ) was certainly made from all frozen or canned ingredients . it had zero flavor , and was served with what looked amp tasted like canned tomato sauce that nothing had been done to , literally dumped out onto the plate , in a thin red pool . the peas served alongside were cooked to the point of resembling a wet copy of le monde . my friend had bar ( european bass ) , which came with the most unappetizing pile of long , long , long overcooked fennel that was army gray . she pronounced it inedible after tasting one piece . i declined her offer for a taste . ( how hard is it to toss fresh shaved fennel in lemon juice and salt , with perhaps a bit of anchovy and or black pepper ? ) her first course foie gras ( 17 . 90 ) was very good ( although hard to mess up ) , but could n't redeem the mains . as much as i want to ensure these kinds of places survive , they are shooting themselves in the foot by serving food marginally better than what is served on a coach class flight . it really is n't that hard to make decent bistro food . or am i missing something ? i 'll eat almost anything if it 's edible and when the waitress picked up the plates , she looked at them , and said nothing . damage for 2 80 ( we skipped dessert . . . )	food

4079892543	negative	4079892543.jpg	a greater manchester police crime scene investigator searches for fingerprint evidence during a training exercise . csis spend many painstaking hours searching for the smallest piece of evidence that could lead to an arrest . fingerprints have been used by the police for over 100 years but the fact that the pattern of the skin on fingers is unique to an individual has been known for much longer . the world s first fingerprint bureau was founded in india in 1897 . two members of the bureau s staff , azizul haque and hem chandra bose developed a fingerprint classification system known as the henry system which formed the basis of modern fingerprinting . the metropolitan police fingerprint branch ( using the henry system ) opened in 1901 . today , computer based systems mean that huge numbers of fingerprints can be checked in the search to find an offender . to find out more about greater manchester police please visit our website . a href http www . gmp . police . uk rel nofollow www . gmp . police . uk a you should call 101 , the new national non emergency number , to report crime and other concerns that do not require an emergency response . always call 999 in an emergency , such as when a crime is in progress , violence is being used or threatened or where there is danger to life . you can also call anonymously with information about crime to crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 . crimestoppers is an independent charity who will not want your name , just your information . your call will not be traced or recorded and you do not have to go to court or give a statement .	glass

6216399155	negative	6216399155.jpg	yesterday afternoon , one of the mums mentioned to me that there was smashed glass all over the passage near my house . this location is a few yards from a primary school and the route to and from school for dozens of children from 0 10 on their way to schools and children 's centres in harringay . with the help of a friend , who called veolia haringey , i swept the glass to one side and we did our best to make it safer for kids to pass . we were told it would be cleared by morning , which we thought was only just satisfactory . enterprise may have had many faults but their response to dangerous fly tips was always excellent . at 9am after dropping my kids off , i went to check and found that many shards of glass had been left behind after they had cleared the pane , including very large ones . i'm sure it would n't take much to imagine what that little lot could do to a 3 yr old on her way to messy play at the ladder children 's centre if she tripped and fell or the feet of a dog , perhaps guiding a blind person down the passage or even someone a little bleary eyed in a pair of sandals or soft soled shoes . i 've been on the phone to veolia to register a complaint . i am deeply dissatisfied with the standards of cleaning around the school over the past week or so . a glass strip light was cleared earlier but lots of tiny shards of glass were left behind and are still there . a glass bottle smashed by the school gate has been left for a couple of days . a bin was overflowing on monday morning and had been joined by a purple veolia bag left to be ripped open by foxes and various bags of junk from fly tippers . this all within a couple of feet of an infants school gate . we may be cross at the idiots who leave this stuff around schools but once these problems are reported , is it too much to ask that they be prioritised for cleaning and that extra care is taken by cleaners to leave school routes spick and span for tiny feet ? b update b the glass was cleared by lunchtime but i'm still waiting for the phone call back from local manager to discuss cleaning around the school	glass

5068987721	negative	5068987721.jpg	solidago , commonly called goldenrods , is a genus of about 100 species of flowering plants in the family asteraceae . most are herbaceous perennial species found in the meadows and pastures , along roads , ditches and waste areas in north america . there are also a few species native to mexico , south america , and eurasia . some american species have also been introduced into europe and other parts of the world . this picture was taken in liguria , italy . the many goldenrod species can be difficult to distinguish , due to their similar bright , golden yellow flower heads that bloom in late summer . goldenrod is often unfairly blamed for causing hay fever in humans . the pollen causing these allergy problems is mainly produced by ragweed ( ambrosia sp . ) , blooming at the same time as the goldenrod , but is wind pollinated . goldenrod pollen is too heavy and sticky to be blown far from the flowers , and is thus mainly pollinated by insects . parts of some goldenrods can be edible when cooked . goldenrods can be used for decoration and making tea . goldenrods are , in some places , held as a sign of good luck or good fortune . native americans chewed the leaves to relieve sore throats and chewed the roots to relieve toothaches . the goldenrod is the state flower of the u . s . states of kentucky ( adopted march 16 , 1926 ) and nebraska ( adopted april 4 , 1895 ) . it used to be the state flower of alabama , being adopted as such on september 6 , 1927 , but was later rejected in favour of the camellia . goldenrod was recently named the state wildflower for south carolina . in midwestern states in the mid twentieth century it was said that when the goldenrod bloomed , it would soon be time to go back to school the blossoms appeared in mid to late august , shortly before the traditional start of school on the day after labor day .	insect

5093346388	negative	5093346388.jpg	ok today my wife and i had some time to spend together and we decided to check out the new ifc shopping mall and the apple store . well the mall was all but deserted ( i anticipate some empty retail spaces there real soon , if today was anything to judge by ) . after the mall which took us about 30 minutes , to review were at a lose end so we decided to do something a little for us at least unusual and visit the shanghai wild insect museum . well i had high hopes of capturing some great shots of butterflies , or other great insects , however the visit was very disappointing . there are many exhibits , but they are held in dirty cases , with very subdued lighting making it almost impossible to see most of the insects , if they have n't already burrowed their way into the earth at the bottom of the display case . add to this filthy glass cases which obscured your view even further . the butterfly case had 6 , and i counted to be sure , butterflies , all but two were some black winged and rather unattractive breed . the vegetation inside the case was dying which probably did n't help the mortality of the butterflies . there is a central area with a rope bridge suspended over an even more filthy large pond area full of small goldfish . here i found a few children playing happily , so i guess they are the visitors that count . most areas which held anything larger than a beetle had a rather strong odor ( i 'll leave it to your imagination ) , as nothing seemed to be properly cleaned anywhere in the facility . in the main entrance was a solitary and in my opinion very unhappy sea lion that was swimming in circles in a small confined tank , which reminded very much of large wild animals that you might see in zoos pacing endlessly in a vain attempt to find a way to escape their confinement . i read online tonight that this facility is only two years old ( i'm guessing the article was written a few years ago ) but even so i am amazed it could look the way it does , much older than its years . anyway if you or any of your visiting friends and family are planning on a visit to shanghai wild insect museum , i 'd suggest they save the 50rmb ( 40rmb with expo tickets ) entrance fee and take a trip to century park instead . with the expo here in shanghai this year i'm rather surprised that the local government did n't see fit to invest some of the billions of yuan they spent on other projects on sprucing this place up a little , it sure could use some tlc . the picture above was taken in the museum but i have no clue what exactly these cute creatures are , but they reminded me of mogwai of the gremlin movies and were very playful .	insect

15148939643	negative	15148939643.jpg	back in the day jackrabbit trail was a first link between moreno and redlands the road now officially abandoned first opened in 1897 as a poorly planned dirt route with steep slopes and plentiful curves by steve lech for the press enterprise published feb . 27 , 2014 9 17 p . m . the old abandoned road connecting gilman springs road with highway 60 was known as jackrabbit trail for most of its existence . although the more business and tourist minded leaders throughout the county tried in vain to have the name changed to something more appealing , the epithet stuck . today it remains one of the more scenic , albeit difficult , drives in our area . when riverside county formed in 1893 , riverside emerged as the county seat . one of the first issues the new county faced was building good roads into riverside so all of the residents could access county services . this didn t happen quickly quot the riverside press in december 1896 lamented there is at present no road by which the people of beaumont and banning can reach the county seat without a detour through san bernardino county . the board of supervisors soon rectified that by voting to look into building a road from beaumont to moreno . two supervisors , john shaver and henry thompson , took that vote literally and began building a road themselves . by february 1897 , the road was built and named the beaumont moreno road . the route was a poorly planned , with no survey and slopes in excess of 25 percent in some places . in addition , john shaver had built some of the road in beaumont along a right of way owned by the southern pacific railroad , which filed suit against the county . shaver and thompson s road was never used for any heavy traffic , and it was soon abandoned , but not before earning the name jackrabbit trail for its many curves . in 1913 , the newly appointed riverside county highway commission began looking into much needed roads throughout the county , and one of the top priorities , just like in 1896 , was a good , stable road between beaumont and moreno . with the passage of highway bonds in 1914 , the riverside county began construction of a new road , this time including a proper survey . the chosen route was basically the same as the shaver thompson road , along what at the time was called chine canyon , but it followed the ridges instead of the valleys . the thoroughfare was to be a graded road with no paving , since the natural compacted soil was thought to be sufficient . after what was described in the press as several months of difficult engineering work , construction finally commenced late in 1915 . it took nearly a year for the contractor to finish , and the new highway was hailed as a breakthrough at its opening in october 1916 . unfortunately , the lack of pavement made the new road impassable several times during the wet season , and calls for paving jackrabbit trail were heard almost immediately . pavement finally was added in 1924 , and the opening of that paved section meant that motorists could drive all the way from los angeles to palm springs in less than 4 hours , all on paved roads . jackrabbit trail was supplanted in 1936 with the opening of a new connection through the badlands along the current route of highway 60 . the badlands route was further upgraded to freeway status in 1956 , and jackrabbit trail fell into disuse . finally , in august 1986 , riverside county removed jackrabbit trail from its maintained roads database . it is still passable and still offers great views of the county quot but only in high clearance vehicles . if you have an idea for a future back in the day column about a local historic person , place or event , contact steve lech and kim jarrell johnson at backinthedaype gmail . com .	road

4314855680	positive	4314855680.jpg	project 365 29 ok , i know what you 're thinking . yes , this was taken with a camera phone , 1mp if i'm lucky . normally i would n't commit such an atrocity or say this was even reasonably worthy of submitting but thinking about this project , i feel like it is a documentation of my life as each day the photo is related to something i did . last night i went to parachute music festival to see one of my favourite bands , falling up , play their last show before splitting up . i did n't want to take my shiny dslr with me as i knew i wanted to be right in there in the crowd when they came on . and in fact , i 've been thinking about the emergence of all these low quality images which have emerged since camera phones became mainstream . they are often used in a moment of 'i have to get this shot but i do n't have a camera . i have to capture this moment even though i know it wo n't turn out very good . ' in a way , the low quality creates almost an abstract work where the image more becomes a composition of shapes and light and colour . the photographer will always remember what the original subject and remember that feeling in that moment which they just had to capture . i'm not saying it 's art , but i'm saying it is valid it has feeling and emotion behind it and in that , the concept is just as important as the work itself . so that was what happened on day 29 365 . the concert was , in fact , nothing short of epic .	band

16185164932	positive	16185164932.jpg	this is sort of a redemption bird for me . sage thrashers are not common in illinois , in fact this is only the seventh time one has been reported in the state since records have been kept on such things . so , it was definitely worth driving a couple of hours in the pre dawn darkness to find this bird . i term it a quot redemption bird quot because one was reported at montrose a couple of years ago and i could not get out to see it in time . of course i went there the day after it was last seen . with that being said i headed off to putnam county , il to find this more recently reported bird . the directions on the birding websites were very precise and i had no trouble finding the area that the bird has been frequenting . before the sun rose i walked along the line of trees looking for a fruiting juniper and i found the bird right away . all i had to do now was wait for the light . i took a couple of record shots at iso 4000 just to have something in case the bird decided to leave , thankfully that would not be an issue . it flew off to a small patch of woods a couple of times but kept returning to this same juniper tree . for a bird species that has a bit of reputation for being skittish around people , this individual was very relaxed and approachable . an awesome bird and a wonderful experience !	bird

b canon 1 . 4x iii extender notes b added with the 100 400mm you can get some shots but it 's not perfect . on most bodies , if you want auto focus to work , you need to quot tape the extender quot to trick the camera into using auto focus . you can read more about it here a href http www . michaelfurtman . com taping the pins . htm rel nofollow www . michaelfurtman . com taping the pins . htm a the 1 . 4x iii extender is fairly new so i wanted to see if the newer version did a better job than the older ones . if you have good light , it will work well . i really have to do some more tests to see if it is as clear as without and just cropping more . it 's hard to not want to try and use this , 1 . 4 x 400 560mm , an amazing zoom for an l lens . i also have the 2x extender but auto focus does not work for that , so it will not be used as much . when using the extender you will notice that the autofocus is much slower and will hunt to focus sometimes for way too long , meaning you will miss shots . i missed a bunch of shots when using this extender . i also got some awesome shots like the one above . b wildlife notes b i am reading a wildlife photography book and one of the tips is to find places within 10 15 miles near you that has wildlife and photograph there , so that is why i have been visiting great falls so much . after spending a few days there , i knew my 3 main animals were great blue herons , double crested cormorants and white tailed deer . the great blue heron will hang out on the rocks beside the river and will stand motionless . they are very tall at around 4 feet tall and are built to use their long legs and long claws to walk in deeper waters where most birds can not stand . they use their long neck to stab at fish , which they do n't impale but simply clasp . the neck folds up in an s shape while flying . the double crested cormorant is an awesome bird , too . they also mainly eat fish and wildlife , but they are built completely different . they are smaller but also eat similar food as the great blue heron , but they hunt differently . instead of hanging out on the rocks , the cormorants will get in the water and dive underwater using their short stumpy legs and very wide , webbed feet to easily navigate underwater . if you watch the rapids carefully at great falls you will notice a cormorant in the water after a while . just look for the black head and orange yellow beak coming out of the water . the double crested cormorant can dive upto 25 feet below and stay under for up to 70 seconds . it is amazing , how these two different animals evolved differently and are using their specific skills to basically do the same thing , hunt for fish . a href http en . wikipedia . org wiki double crested cormorant rel nofollow en . wikipedia . org wiki double crested cormorant a last photo note argghhh !

if only he had been looking towards the heron or me . although the lighting was bad so it would have been hard to catch . this is the problem with shooting at such late hours . 10 45am is way too late . also i noticed that cormorants will camp up the rapids , do some fishing and then go down the rapids , just like kayakers do . are they having fun , fishing , or just going down stream to easily launch and fly off ? who knows , but its fun to watch d i had just recently observed this and it was so amazing to get a chance to photograph the floating cormorant so close to my subject , i just wish it came out a little better . oh well , trial and error . i will probably not use the 1 . 4x extender when sitting on those rocks . i missed some amazing shots because of the slow auto focus . hey , why not enjoy some sting while you view photos ? from the awesome imax movie , the living sea , check out this sting song !

9513931605	positive	9513931605.jpg	such a pleasant surprise in my back yard early yesterday morning ! nothing warms my heart more than seeing a parent bird feed it 's newly fledged babes , and i 've been blessed with observing this wonderful behavior 3 out of the last 4 years in 3 different places that i was living at the time . anyone who has been quot invaded quot by a flock of evening grosbeaks knows that they do n't much follow any set patterns or rules appearing out of nowhere in huge numbers , cleaning out feeders in a matter of minutes for several days , then not seen at all for months at a time . when i lived up on windham hill , i could hear them coming long before they arrived and was never unhappy to see them . i even traveled out to the feed store in one of the biggest snow storms ever , because they had wiped me out of bird seed and i just could n't bare to have empty feeders for my birds in the dead of winter . i do adore them so quot gross quot beaks or not . the first time i ever saw one of the males , i thought it was someone 's escaped pet parrot and the only photo i 've ever had chosen for special recognition by anyone , other than flickr explore , was a portrait of a male evening grosbeak by the quot great backyard bird count quot folks way back in 2009 . most of the winter that year , there had been dozens of them at the feeders almost constantly . but when the 4 day weekend in february came to quot count birds quot ( and take current photos for a chance to be chosen as only one of 500 slots ) not a one was in sight . then out of nowhere , a lone male spent some time with me and i was able to get a nice enough picture to win a spot . but nothing nothing delights me more than to witness a father feeding his youngster . i know lots of male birds take on this role , and maybe it 's because the grosbeaks are so boldly marked and have such vivid coloring , that i have quot noticed quot this behavior often . it might also be that the papas of this particular species are much like human fathers if the kids are hungry , take them out to the nearest quot fast food joint quot to shut them up . ( below is a photo also from yesterday , of a male cardinal taking parenting lessons from this evening grosbeak father , and if anyone thinks it 's a little late in the summer for fledging 2 other photos from 2011 and 2010 showing that indeed you know to never expect any sticking to even moderate time tables or calendars from these awesome birds .	bird

8128147931	positive	8128147931.jpg	i thought this shot of a mother showing her little boy how to feed the turtles at reed canal park was just precious ! the turtles , knowing that people do that , come up to the bridge when they see people at the edge , and they were swimming as fast as they could to get there when these two arrived . i thought it would be interesting with this shot to do a couple of different crops , so you can see how different perspectives can really change the effect of the shot . i used selective color on this one because i did n't really want to soften the lines of the bridge and trees , but did n't want them overpowering the people , either . the color makes your eye go to the people to see what they 're doing , but then because the focus is still clear on the other parts of the photo , you take in the scene , as well . i also tried to keep each crop as perfect in composition as i could , using the rule of thirds to place the emphasis where i wanted the focus to be on the mother 's hands , as she opened the baggie with food for the turtles , or on hers and her child 's faces . i think that 's why the integrity of the shot remains from crop to crop . i finished the top shot by adding a filter and a fabric texture to give it the look of canvas . the other shots had little but vignetting and cropping done . the sooc shot is the first below .	boy

3232986261	positive	3232986261.jpg	how to make a doughboy cake first i have to say that this was my very first time making a cake ! my mom is a professional cake decorator . she 's made many wedding cakes . over the years i 've watched her decorate cakes and for her 52nd birthday i decided to give it a try to surprise her . ) so here are my step by step instructions on how to make the cake i made . . . . . i started off by buying a 1974 wilton pillsbury doughboy cake pan mold on line , which measure 14 quot x8 quot . i coated the inside of the doughboy cake can with quot crisco spray , with pillsbury flour quot . it was amazing ! the cake never stuck . i bought 1 box of pillsbury moist supreme devil 's food cake mix and baked it according to the directions on the box . i let the cake cool completely . frosting 3 4 cup shortening 2 lbs . powered sugar 2 cap fulls of butter flavoring 2 cap fulls of almond flavoring 1 2 cup water cut shortening into pieces in mixing bowl . add powdered sugar and beat ( you may want to place a towel around the bowl so powered sugar does n't go everywhere ) . add butter and almond flavoring . while mixing , slowly add water . mix well on high until creamy . note keep the frosting covered with saran wrap while frosting the cake so that it wo n't dry out . after making the frosting i dipped out two small bowls of frosting . to these bowls i added the wiltons food coloring . i bought all my cake decorating supplies at wal mart . for the brown outline i bought wiltons brown icing color . for the doughboy blue color i bought wiltons royal blue icing color . for the decorating part i bought a box of wiltons 12 inch disposable decorating bags . my cake icing tips were for outlining in brown , a 5 round tip for starring in white and blue , a 21 open star tip . i also bought some couplers ( to hold the tip unto the bags ) . after filling the bags i outlined doughboy 's features in the brown frosting with the 5 round tip first . after that i star tipped all of the white areas with the 21 open star tip . for his hat band i used the same 21 open star tip , but i just did stripes instead of stars . after i was done with the white color , i washed the 21 open star tip and stuck it on the blue bag . then i filled in all the blue areas of the doughboy . for the knot on his neck tie , and just did a round swirl , making it look like a knot ( i did the same thing for his nose , except in white ) . for his eyes and button on his hat i squeezed out a large star from the same 21 open star tip . and voila you have a cute pillsbury doughboy cake ! ) tip if you plan on decorating the cake the day before , i would n't add the blue frosting until hours before the party because it will bleed blue coloring onto the white frosting . i have a blog with more details and step by step photos on how to decorate the doughboy cake here a href http skweakys kitchen nook . blogspot . com rel nofollow skweakys kitchen nook . blogspot . com a	cake

2876286113	positive	2876286113.jpg	greystones ( irish na clocha liatha ) is a coastal town in county wicklow , ireland . it is located on ireland s east coast , 8 km ( 5 miles ) south of bray and 27 km ( 17 mi ) south of dublin ( it is within the greater dublin area ) , with a population in the region of 15 , 000 . the town s name is derived from a one kilometre stretch of coastal grey rocks situated between two beaches this rocky area is known as the sea front . the harbour area and the railway station are at the northern and southern ends respectively . the north beach , which begins at the harbour , is a stony beach and some of its length is overlooked by the southern cliffs of bray head , which are subject to erosion . the south beach is a broad expansive sandy beach about one kilometre long . it was a blue flag beach and receives many visitors and tourists , mainly in the summer . the town is bordered by the irish sea to the east , bray head to the north and the wicklow mountains to the west . greystones is located south of the site of an ancient castle of the barony of rathdown . there was a hamlet which , like the castle , was known as rathdown , and which appeared on a 1712 map . this site occupied an area now known as the grove , about a quarter mile north of greystones harbour , but only the ruins of a chapel , st . crispin 's cell , survive . greystones is a much more recent settlement and is first mentioned in topographia hibernica , a 1795 publication . here it is described as a noted fishing place four miles beyond bray . in the early 1800s , there were some families scattered around the harbour , blacklion , windgates , killincarrig and rathdown . delgany was a more substantial and longer established village . however , greystones was put on the map with the coming of the railway in 1855 , a difficult undertaking which was performed in consultation with isambard kingdom brunel , the famous engineer . the train station was built on the line dividing the properties of two landowners the la touche family of bellevue house ( now in ruins , near delgany ) , and the hawkins whitshed family of killincarrig house ( which is now greystones golf club ) . it provided links with bray and dublin , and left room for development on the adjoining estates . in the latter half of the nineteenth century , under the ownership of william robert la touche , greystones' development gathered momentum . to the north of the station , church road , victoria road , and trafalgar road were laid out and many houses were built in the years following the arrival of the railway . following her father 's death , elizabeth hawkins whitshed was the sole inheritor of his property . in 1879 , she married frederick gustavus burnaby a soldier , politician and traveller . burnaby died in battle in 1885 and elizabeth remarried twice , but the property continued to be known as the burnaby estate . in the early 1900s , the burnabys began to expand the town on their side of the station , and the roads and houses of the burnaby were developed and the population grew considerably . the names of these two families remain well known today , with many roads and housing estates bearing their names . between 1885 and 1897 , the people of greystones campaigned for a harbour to aid the fishing industry and imports such as coal . the pier , dock , sea wall and boat slip remain but have endured substantial damage . in the early 1900s , the town felt the effects of coastal erosion ( which is still a major problem ) the loss of fields and most of the houses on the north beach road , and the costly inland relocation of the railway have all resulted . in 1968 , the old kish lighthouse foundation was added to the end of the pier . at the end of world war ii , cars and petrol became widely available , allowing greystones to gradually expand , filling in the space between itself and outlying areas such as blacklion , killincarrig , and delgany . however , the popularity of the railway declined its very existence being in jeopardy during the 1980s , as government cutbacks reduced the service to just a few trains per day . the 1990s brought a revival of sorts with the arrival of the electrified dart from bray , and a much more frequent schedule . greystones has experienced a huge increase in its population since the 1970s with the construction of several large housing estates . a new development at charlesland , just south of the town , includes over 1 , 000 dwelling units . as of the 2006 census the population of greystones , including town and environs , stands at 14 , 569 making it the second largest town in the county after bray . along with the housing developments , road networks and facilities have been improved to cater for the growth . the road between greystones and bray has been widened and realigned . a new dual carriageway link road ( r774 ) connecting greystones to the n11 has been completed . construction of a full interchange with the n11 is under way . according to the 2006 census , greystones has the largest church of ireland presence as a proportion of the population ( 9 . 77 ) .	castle

much more recent settlement and is first mentioned in topographia hibernica , a 1795 publication . here it is described as a noted fishing place four miles beyond bray . in the early 1800s , there were some families scattered around the harbour , blacklion , windgates , killincarrig and rathdown . delgany was a more substantial and longer established village . however , greystones was put on the map with the coming of the railway in 1855 , a difficult undertaking which was performed in consultation with isambard kingdom brunel , the famous engineer . the train station was built on the line dividing the properties of two landowners the la touche family of bellevue house ( now in ruins , near delgany ) , and the hawkins whitshed family of killincarrig house ( which is now greystones golf club ) . it provided links with bray and dublin , and left room for development on the adjoining estates . in the latter half of the nineteenth century , under the ownership of william robert la touche , greystones' development gathered momentum . to the north of the station , church road , victoria road , and trafalgar road were laid out and many houses were built in the years following the arrival of the railway . following her father 's death , elizabeth hawkins whitshed was the sole inheritor of his property . in 1879 , she married frederick gustavus burnaby a soldier , politician and traveller . burnaby died in battle in 1885 and elizabeth remarried twice , but the property continued to be known as the burnaby estate . in the early 1900s , the burnabys began to expand the town on their side of the station , and the roads and houses of the burnaby were developed and the population grew considerably . the names of these two families remain well known today , with many roads and housing estates bearing their names . between 1885 and 1897 , the people of greystones campaigned for a harbour to aid the fishing industry and imports such as coal . the pier , dock , sea wall and boat slip remain but have endured substantial damage . in the early 1900s , the town felt the effects of coastal erosion ( which is still a major problem ) the loss of fields and most of the houses on the north beach road , and the costly inland relocation of the railway have all resulted . in 1968 , the old kish lighthouse foundation was added to the end of the pier . at the end of world war ii , cars and petrol became widely available , allowing greystones to gradually expand , filling in the space between itself and outlying areas such as blacklion , killincarrig , and delgany . however , the popularity of the railway declined its very existence being in jeopardy during the 1980s , as government cutbacks reduced the service to just a few trains per day . the 1990s brought a revival of sorts with the arrival of the electrified dart from bray , and a much more frequent schedule . greystones has experienced a huge increase in its population since the 1970s with the construction of several large housing estates . a new development at charlesland , just south of the town , includes over 1 , 000 dwelling units . as of the 2006 census the population of greystones , including town and environs , stands at 14 , 569 making it the second largest town in the county after bray . along with the housing developments , road networks and facilities have been improved to cater for the growth . the road between greystones and bray has been widened and realigned . a new dual carriageway link road ( r774 ) connecting greystones to the n11 has been completed . construction of a full

15747018698	positive	15747018698.jpg	cheetahs first time mother addison and her 4 adorable cubs . the 2 males ( wgasa and refu ) and 2 females ( pumzika and mahala ) were born at the safari park breeding center on july 13 , 2014 . the cheetah is a large feline inhabiting most of africa and parts of iran . the cheetah is a unique felid , with its closest living relatives being the puma and jaguarondi . the cheetah is still considered by some to be the smallest of the big cats . it is often mistaken for the leopard , but the cheetah has distinguishing features , such as the tear streak lines that run from its eyes to its mouth , and the thinner body frame of the cheetah is also very different from that of the leopard . this cat is notable for being only one of three felids with only semi retractable claws , offering extra grip in its high speed pursuits . cheetahs are the fastest of land mammals , are peaceable except at breeding time . they hunt alone and don t have any of the group behaviors that lions do . a cheetah cannot roar , it uses a high pitched barking called chirping . growling is often accompanied by hissing and spitting and is exhibited if the cheetah is annoyed , or when faced with danger . purring as with most cats , is when the cheetah is content , usually between cubs and their mothers . san diego zoo safari park has been introducing dogs to calm the skittish cats and bring attention to their plight . pairing quot companion dogs quot with cheetahs to serve as playmates and to comforting and reassuring the cheetah . cheetahs are the world 's biggest scaredy cats . the dogs are the bosses in these relationships , the dog always has the cat 's back , but it 's never the other way around . dogs worry about and protect their cats . the san diego zoo was given a pair of cheetahs in 1981 on the condition they be given dogs because they were used to them . san diego zoo safari park is the top u . s . breeder of cheetahs in captivity . in the past 40 years , over 140 cheetahs have been born at the park 's breeding facility . with 6 recent births . a pair from allie , and 4 cubs from addison . cheetahs are included on the international union for conservation of nature ( iucn ) list of vulnerable species ( african subspecies threatened , asiatic subspecies in critical situation ) as well as on the us endangered species act threatened species hope you enjoy ! pix . by . pegisue a href https www . flickr . com photos pix by pegisue www . flickr . com photos pix by pegisue a taken sandiegozoo safari park , escondido , ca	cat

6471134549	positive	6471134549.jpg	the birthplace of gothic architecture , where all new developments in church building were successfully brought together in 1140 , can still be visited in the basilique saint denis , the royal burial church north of paris . it is well worth the trip just to walk from the station through the largely african and arab banlieu of seine saint denis , a reminder of how myopic a view of modern france tourists are usually offered . abbot suger , who was behind rebuilding the ancient church of saint denis in the new style , only managed to construct the west front and the choir , and of the choir only the double ambulatory shown here has survived , as restored by viollet le duc . for such a momentous event in architectural history , the ambulatory is surprisingly small . compared with the monumental nave , built a hundred years later , it is positively tiny , but even next to the original 8th century nave , size was not what made this choir stand out . poetry was . a poetry of light , lightness and allusion . the wall of coloured glass here had been unthinkable until this moment in time . an analytical reworking of vaulting itself was behind the revolution . you know its main elements the pointed arch which made a much more precise delivery of forces to piers and walls possible , the ribs focusing the weight and reducing the major part of the vault to a mere soap film of stone , and finally the buttressing which you do n't see here and that was the whole point of it handling the forces of the outer walls outside the building , making room for rows of great windows with very little visible stonework to disturb them . to the populace of a medieval , shit drenched capital in northern europe the effect must have been magic . it was meant to be . it would have been magic today , if it was n't for the electric light which reverses the intended levels of light , making the interior brighter than the november day outside and reducing the stained glass to a flat tapestry . a little darkness would have made things a lot easier to see . the greatest surprise for me was the classical columns , actual roman spolia and an allusion to antiquity that would not have gone unnoticed among the educated visitors to the church . the middle ages were full of heirs to rome , why not include the dead french kings ? i have made my usual bold claims about the connection between gothic and roman architecture a href http www . flickr . com photos seier 4953858698 here a , but to see roman columns at the very beginning of gothic still came as a shock . for a moment , i thought i was in the wrong place . it was no easy marriage as you can tell from the struggle to land all the spidery stone ribs on top of each corinthian capital , and soon enough gothic builders had developed their own highly articulated vocabulary of piers and shafts to support their highly articulated vaults . yet motifs from classical architecture kept cropping up throughout the middle ages . the english later called this the i ghost of the orders i , a hauntingly beautiful name from a time when the orders still carried meaning . there are no ghosts in the basilique saint denis today . the dead kings are gone since the revolution , and despite sarkozy , nobody misses them . the church , restored several times since the 19th century , has the sanitized feel of a museum and stands in a small enclave of perceived frenchness , divorced from its surroundings . as such , it keeps telling us about france even if the story is no longer what its builders intended . i this photo was uploaded with a cc license and may be used free of charge and in any way you see fit . if possible , please name photographer quot seier seier quot . if not , do n't . i	church

( tagore ) . iridescent clouds are a beautiful phenomenon but they 're rarely seen and even less frequently photographed . iridescent clouds , known as quot fire rainbows quot or quot rainbow clouds , quot occur when sunlight diffracts off water droplets in the atmosphere . and the recipe for these heavenly sights is actually pretty simple . what happens is that the cumulus cloud , boiling upwards , pushes the air layers above it higher and higher . as the air gets pushed upwards , it expands and cools . and sometimes moisture in that air suddenly condenses into tiny droplets to form a cap cloud . this quot cap quot which scientists call a quot pileus quot is the source of the brilliant spectacle . the droplets in the cap cloud scatter sunlight to form the gorgeous colors . i felt very lucky to have seen this . it 's a very rare sight . california .	cloud

8355844685	positive	8355844685.jpg	pratt wayne woods wayne , illinois these geese were coming in for a landing but have you ever wondered about the v formation they make when they are all flying overhead ? here are some intersting facts i found on the web when a goose leaves the formation he feels the resistance of the air and the difficulties of flying alone , then , he quickly comes back to the formation to take advantage of the flock s power in front of him . when the leader goose gets tired of flying he goes to the end of the v formation . while another goose takes the lead . the geese flying in a v formation quack to encourage the ones in the front . in that way , they keep the same speed . as each goose flaps its wings it creates an uplift for the birds that follow . by flying in a 'v' formation the whole flock adds 71 percent extra to the flying range . when a goose gets sick , is injured or gets tired and he must leave the formation , other geese leave the formation too , and they fly with him to help him out and protect him . they remain with him until he dies or he is able to fly again . they reach their bevy or they just make another v formation . have a great weekend everyone )	cloud

14802160267	positive	14802160267.jpg	really the only things a wedding truly really needs can be a bride , a groom , a minister as well as , love . the rest is just not needed . they can be added extras that can make the time more delightful , but are not necessities . this informative article can aid you to keep in mind the important matters where you can truly happy big day . a very important factor you must think of in the wedding planning process is really what alcohol will probably be served , and the way much you wish to pay for it . keeping a wide open bar does n't come cheap , but keeping it open on an extended time might be more costly . seek advice from your venue to determine the alcohol options they already have that you can choose between . choose wedding decorations that reflect your personality and therefore of your respective partner . your decorations should likewise help tell the storyline of your respective relationship together with the person . choose a theme that is representative of some time that you may have spent collectively . there 's nothing more significant in the wedding than the individual that you will be marrying . do n't rush into this decision . weigh everything you know about your partner , and think of everything linked to experiencing this person forever . if you would like increase your look on the day of your wedding however they are within a strict budget , something that you can do is usually to rent diamonds . this gives you the stunning look that you want and often will not amount to a ton of money , helping you to adhere to your budget . ask local boutiques about having small , individual portions of cake to the guests for your wedding . many bakeries offer beautiful cupcakes with various healthy fillings . an incredible gift for your personal guests at the destination wedding can be a basket that you may have transported to their room loaded with vacation goodies . include maps , cameras , hats , disposable cameras , or guides on local attractions that they can may wish to visit . it could be nice also to include helpful information for local restaurants so it will be easy to enable them to eat . a wedding only truly needs several things for success . the rest you possess can be a bonus , taking you an incredible wedding to a awesome one . these matters might be a nice addition , but they also add unnecessary stress which will take focus clear of happiness this day entails . with this article , you will have a wonderful wedding everyone will love . a href http www . whisperevents . com . au rel nofollow www . whisperevents . com . au a	cupcake

3288885828	positive	3288885828.jpg	this out of the world cupcake takes its name from the one and only solar roasted solaris blend coffee made here in colorado . from the flour to the chocolate the ingredients are fresh , organic , and in a few cases , locally made all factors which add to the delicious nature of the solaris cupcake . as its name implies , the delicate yet moist chocolate coffee cake is made with a double shot of solaris espresso . many beautiful cupcakes are guilty of being either overbearingly sweet or deathly bland . the rich ganache and the tender cake of the solaris are instead tempered by the bittersweet flavor of the candied orange and complimented by the cinnamon spice and orange extract . the resulting flavor of the solaris neither overwhelms nor bores , but rather each bite of this delectable cupcake gently awakens and satisfies your senses . the cupcake is truly cosmic and absolutely perfect alone or with a rich cup of fresh coffee . visit the cupcake at my blog a href http conundrumcupcakery . blogspot . com 2009 02 solaris cosmic coffee cupcake . html rel nofollow solaris a	cupcake

5159820285	positive	5159820285.jpg	the relaunch of torontolife . com 's food porn column starts with a post about the city 's most beautiful cupcakes . this topic was one suggested by my editor . despite my initial hesitations ( really ? cupcakes ? that 's so 2005 ! ) , we did have a twist on it finding the best looking ( tasting would obviously be as important ) . i 'll confess that at the end of the day , i did look forward to see how creative some of the artisans bakers were . with regards to the selection process , all candidates were my pitches based on familiarity or by reputation . i was really surprised by how amazing some looked others by their taste . a week of cupcake tasting testing ( with a motley crew of cupcake lovers and most importantly for me , ones who could actually eat cocoa laced products on my behalf ) was n't something i looked forward to ( given that i'm more a savouries person than one for sweets ) , but i was quite happy to discover some favourites along with being wowed by the details infused in others . on a wild note , one of my members claims she developed an allergy to cupcakes ( likely to ingredients found within it but i think has been fine with eating those same ingredients elsewhere ) including anaphylaxis . perhaps she 's experiencing the same allergy development as i did to cocoa ? only time will tell ( and for her sake , i hope not ! ) . i bring you toronto 's most beautiful cupcakes curated as of nov 2010 . these are a representative selection from the following cupcake vendors sweetthings , omg baked goodness , wicked little cake company , she takes the cake , whole foods , sweetthings , eini amp co , the cupcakery , lpk culinary groove .	cupcake

6657626231	positive	6657626231.jpg	i these beautiful cupcakes , you made with your own hands . i 'd eat them with you , my dear . i this week i sat and listened to the best 18 hours of teaching i ve ever heard . i listened with every intent as a man named doug easterday told me about the father heart of god . the father heart of god . for you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear , but you received the spirit of adoption . and by it we cry abba father . romans 8 15 brief little linguistics i learned this week the old testament is written in hebrew and the new testament is written in greek . in this verse , which comes from the new testament , the word abba is not greek . it s a word they had to dig up from aramaic just so they could convey the i most accurate i sense of the relationship at hand . the word abba is an aramaic word for father . it even goes beyond that . in aramaic , there are three levels of the language formal , informal , and intimate . the level of intimate language was only reserved for certain people . people you had an unbreakable and deep connection to . people you loved by choice and that choice would never change . abba was reserved for that . and god wanted to communicate that so accurately he switched languages just for a second to get his point across . woah . my world got rocked this week when i learned that god cares about this relationship thing we have going even immeasurably more than i do . and all those times i ached inside at the wound , inflicted by another , his heart wailed and hurt i even more i than mine . wait what ? how is that i possible ? i and that he was so concerned about the state of our relationship and it being as full as it could be that he decided he would inflict the worst kind of pain and watch the one he loved go through agony and excruciating pain , so much so he god of the universe had to turn his face away . all that , just so that he could send his holy spirit . a spirit that would make it possible , on the hurt of all hurts in the night of all nights , i could come to him , in my pj s . i could show up , in a bad mood . and he could greet me at the door and say b i m so glad you re here . i m so glad you came here tonight . b	cupcake

2169333508	positive	2169333508.jpg	i love them . my kids love them . i made them last night along with twice cooked crispy orange beef . very popular at breakfast or in japanese boxed lunches called obento , this omelette has a delicate sweet flavor and a pretty layered look when sliced . you may have tried it already at sushi shops , where a thin slab of rolled omelette is seved atop vinegared rice , wrapped in a strip of nori seaweed . this recipe can be adapted so that it contains more or less sugar , and dashi broth may also be added , depending on your preferences . for a colorful variation , try adding chopped parsley to the beaten eggs before frying . made without sugar it is delicious in sandwiches and rolled sushi . 6 eggs 2 tablespoons sugar 2 teaspoons soy sauce 2 tablespoons sake or mirin 2 teaspoons vegetable oil beat the eggs well and blend in the sugar , soy sauce , and sake . heat oil in a large skillet . over low heat , add 1 6 of the egg mixture and let it spread evenly over the bottom of the skillet . as the egg becomes half done , roll it from one edge of the skillet tot he other and let it rest on one side of the skillet . pour a similar amount of the egg mixture into the skillet , making sure it spreads underneath the resting omelette roll . when this new layer becomes half done , fold the first omelette roll inside , rolling from edge to edge . repeat with another 1 6 of the egg mixture until you have a fairly think omelette roll . slice into thick sections and serve . note it is best to use a square skillet . i like a little bit more soy sauce in the mixture . quot japanese family style recipes quot hiroko urakami	food

5999817426	positive	5999817426.jpg	my mom thinks this photo might be from the mid 1920s . he was much larger and in very poor health by the mid 1930s ( overweight drinking and eating excessively , partially blind due to chronic diabetes , wounds from being shot in his back from wwi that never healed and needed constant attention ) . he also had a tumor in his foot that was later operated on to drain the fluid that was later found to be cancerous . his foot leg was amputated . oma said he had cancer but he also had so many chronic ailments . he died in 1943 . my mom said she has no visual memory of her opa . they had moved to heilbronn for 2 3 years so her father could find work as a tool maker when she was less than a year old her sister stayed behind with her grandfather and grandmother . they were subsequently bombed out of heilbronn ( approx . 1943 ) and moved back to batschsentiwan . on the way back , she was sick ( measels ) and had to go to munich to be hospitalized for a week . within 5 6 months of being back they were interred in concentration camp . my mom and her great grandmother were interned at gokowa . my grandmother was one of the first 100 women told to take care of the soldiers , then a short while later , the rest of the village was interned into different camps . gokowa was 14 miles from where my grandmother and grandfather were interned . they were separated by gender into two separate camps i believe they were in sombor . history in the end of the 17th century the village became part of the habsburg monarchy . a new wave of colonisation occurred in 1748 when many german colonists settled in prigrevica . the colonists came from many different regions in southern germany and east france . the gathering centre was in ulm , germany and from that point they were transported by the danube to apatin , which became the main base of the german expansion in vojvodina . formerly an ethnic german village called a href http en . wikipedia . org wiki prigrevica rel nofollow batschsentiwan a ( translated st . john the baptist , in the batschka region ) in the batschka region , it was overtaken by serb ruler tito and the russian partisans in 1946 . the german townspeople were placed into various concentration camps ( including my mom and her family ) . it is now considered serbia and renamed pregrevica . when the yugoslav partisans came on october 24 , 1944 , they liberated prigrevica from axis occupation . the antifascist council for deliberation of yugoslavia ( avnoj ) declared its mainly german population as public enemies . also in prigrevica the german civil population became victim of excessive revenge of the partisans . they were partially shot , tortured to death or sent to one of several concentration camps that existed until 1948 . after the second world war , prigrevica was settled by colonists who mostly originated from lika and banija . read more here a href http www . scribd . com doc 63502110 ann kuebler breen story rel nofollow surviving wwii communist concentration camp a .	grandfather

1853011098	positive	1853011098.jpg	this is a photograph from my personal collection . in spite of having a misshapen hoof , assault went on to win all three jewels of the triple crown and become the 1946 horse of the year , the most prestigious honor in american thoroughbred racing . you gotta love those underdogs ! foaled on march 26 , 1943 , on robert kleberg , jr . 's king ranch in texas , assault could boast of an impressive pedigree . his sire , bold venture had won the kentucky derby and preakness stakes in 1936 , and his dam , igual , was an unraced mare by the two time horse of the year , equipose . igual 's dam was out of masda , the full sister of the great man o' war . the chestnut colt was named assault in honor of the fact that his sire was a descendant of commando , the 1901 horse of the year and sire of the unbeaten colin . as a weanling , assault stepped on a surveyor 's stake , permanently crippling himself and giving rise to his future nickname , quot the club footed comet . quot when the oddly gaited horse first walked and trotted before max hirsch , the famous racehorse trainer doubted that he would ever make it to the post , let alone the winner 's circle but something told hirsch to give it a shot . assault 's racing career got off to a decidedly lackluster start . after scoring only two wins in nine times out of the gate , he was sent to winter in south carolina . by the time racing season opened 1946 , however , the young horse had his act together , starting the season by winning the experimental handicap and going on to win the wood memorial stakes . but then he faltered . shipped to kentucky for the first jewel of the triple crown , he ran a badly beaten fourth behind rippey , spy song , and with pleasure in the derby trial stakes , casting a long shadow of doubt upon his already seemingly slim kentucky derby chances . on the day of the kentucky derby , lord boswell was the betting favorite , with assault listed as fourth choice . spy song was the early leader in the race , and assault , with jockey warren mehrtens in the saddle , merely ran with the pack . but then the colt caught fire , pulling away from the herd in a burst of speed and thundering down the track for a breathtaking eight length victory , which equaled the longest winning margin in derby history . on may 11 the crowd at pimlico became the first to make assault a post time favorite when he met lord boswell and eight others in the preakness stakes for the second jewel of the triple crown . caught up in a mob of horses , jockey warren mehrtens was forced to press his mount early in the race , and assault was compelled to spend precious energy reserves as he passed natchez in the backstretch . when the horses reached the top of the stretch , assault was in front , with lord boswell four lengths behind , but running powerfully and narrowing the gap . assault hung gamely on despite his fatigue , and although lord boswell closed strongly , assault won by a neck . because of assault 's narrow victory at pimlico and the fact that the track of the third jewel in the triple crown is the longest , lord boswell went to post as the favorite in the belmont stakes . his impressive stretch drive in the preakness seemed to indicate that he could handle the belmont 's mile and a half more easily than could assault , who this time was deemed second choice in the wagering . assault stumbled at the start , leaving hampden to claim the early lead . at the head of the stretch , assault was trailing by a sickening eight lengths when jockey warren mehrtens moved to the outside and asked his horse to give it all he had . assault responded with a powerful surge down the strech , catching natchez to win by three lengths for the climax of an exciting race . before the end of 1946 , trainer max hirsch became disatisfied with warren mehrtens as jockey when the best that assault could score was a disappointing string of seconds , thirds , and fourths . mehrtens was replaced by eddie arcaro . as if to reward hirsch 's judgment , assault trounced his competitors in both the pimlico special and westchester handicap with arcaro aboard , as well being voted 1946 horse of the year honors . assault retired in early 1948 , but his history of physical problems reared up again when it was disclosed that he was sterile . ( note he never succeeded in getting a thouroughbred offspring . it is possible , however , that he did pasture breed some quarterhorse mares who foaled . ) with little else to do but return to racing , assault competed until he was seven , completing his career with 18 victories in 42 starts . he then lived out a quiet , peaceful existence at the king ranch until he was put down at the age of 28 in 1971 after fracturing a leg . despite being named horse of the year in 1946 , many racing authorities of the day discounted assault because he never turned in a spectacular time . they averred assault won the honor only because he was the best in a rather average lot of horses that year . it is true that assault never was the all time fastest . ( his kentucky derby time of 2 06 3 5 was comparatively slow , missing whirlaway 's track record by more than five seconds . ) yet not only did assault run his entire career on a crippled foot but he battled kidney , splint bone , ankle , knee , and bleeding problems as well . few horses could have performed at all under such conditions , let alone racked up such an impressive career . warren mehrtens summed it up best when he said assault quot was all heart . quot in his lifetime , he did set one record , however , that has not been broken to this date . assault remains the only texas bred horse to win the triple crown . in 1964 , assault was inducted into the national museum of racing and hall of fame . eddie arcaro ( arguably history 's all time greatest jockey ) ranked assault second only to citation , and max hirsch stated simply quot i never trained a better horse . quot assault 's race record year starts 42 wins 18 seconds 6 thirds 7 lifetime earnings 675 , 400 ( over 5 million in today 's money ) major racing wins wood memorial ( 1946 ) kentucky derby ( 1946 ) preakness stakes ( 1946 ) belmont stakes ( 1946 ) pimlico special ( 1946 ) suburban handicap ( 1947 ) racing awards 7th u . s . triple crown champion ( 1946 ) u . s . champion 3 year old colt ( 1946 ) united states horse of the year ( 1946 ) honors united states racing hall of fame ( 1964 ) 33 top 100 racehorses of the 20th century	horse

3229756804	positive	3229756804.jpg	in 1987 , a small thoroughbred filly was born in west virginia . she had a prestigious ancestry and name , but as she was cared for by a lady named miss julie , she was known henceforth as quot julie quot . she begin her racing career at age 2 . she was n't a great success on the track like her grandfather , secretariat . she won a total of 72 . at age 4 , she bowed her tendon and went into retirement , ending up at a small farm in nc to recover . that 's where i come in . . . our lives became intertwined many many years ago , in 1992 . i was 12 years old at the time , and i had been riding for just over 3 years at a local barn , taking riding lessons . i considered myself a pretty good rider all around , though i had n't really worked with any young horses to that point . one day , i went to a local breeding farm with my mom , owned by mr . wilson . i remember seeing this chestnut horse in the back pasture , wearing a blue halter , pacing back and forth in the early evening sun . he told me that she was off the track , four years old , and secretariat was her grandfather . a few weeks later , i arrived for my riding lesson only to see the same horse standing in the pasture at the barn where i took lessons . mr . wilson wanted to make her into a hunter jumper , which would increase her sale value . my riding instructor told me that mr . wilson had brought her there for training . and i could help with her training if i wanted to . of course , i jumped at the chance . we started working with her in early january . i used to put her on crossties in the wash rack , which had a wall behind it . we were afraid she 'd pull back since she was so young . after that , i 'd lunge her for a good 30 mins , each direction , to work the kinks out . then i 'd ride her , limiting it to walking and trotting at first . we had several memorable rides , one of which taught me the fine art of the emergency dismount . on that particular windy day , she spooked at something , i lost my balance and then lost control . the reins flew over her head and she took off . i stayed on 2 times around the riding ring before it was n't fun anymore . i jumped off , on the inside of the ring , and she fell on top of me . luckily , neither of us were hurt . we worked together for a few months , during which a bond was forged . . . the likes of which i have n't experienced since in my life . in early may , she had made enough progress to sell . my instructor gave me first choice , and for a fleeting second i had the hopes that it would actually happen . but in the end , my parents refused . they were n't rich , and horses are really really expensive . it 's not the initial cost , it 's the upkeep , my mom explained . i begged , i pleaded , i yelled . i volunteered to get a job , sell myself into slavery , forego the braces that i did n't really want anyway . i tried to make the most out of the time that i had with her . i read in a book that indians used to breathe into the nostrils of their horses , to make sure they remembered them . maybe i knew then that one day our paths would cross again , and i wanted to do everything i could to make sure she remembered me . i took a camera out to the barn and took pictures , one of which is above . i tried to prepare for the inevitable . but nothing could have prepared me for the loss that i would feel . so , julie was sold . the girl who bought her lived in cherry point , and her father was in the marine corps . one day i arrived at the barn , and she was gone . i remember crying my eyes out to country music while sitting on the couch with a box of kleenex . life went on , barely . my instructor gave me another horse to work with . it was n't the same . i kept comparing the new horse to julie . i quit riding in 1993 , not long after 8th grade started . julie was still with me , even though only in glimpses . i convinced my mother to drive me by the stable where she was , and i creened my neck trying to pick her out from the myriad of horses in the pasture . i saw her picture on the back page of an issue of quot horse illustrated quot magazine where owners submitted pictures of their horses ( still have that magazine , in a safe deposit box , btw ) . i tried to keep track of her the best i could . the last news i had was that her new owner was going off to college , and julie was coming with her . then i lost track . many years later , i was returning from my cousin 's house in new bern , and i rode down the road where she used to be . . . . where i saw her for the last time . i sincerely thought that i would never see her again . six months after that drive , in 1998 , i was in college and considering getting back into riding after a particularly stressful semester . i had finally come to accept the fact that i would never find julie , and i needed to move on . it had been over six years . i was sitting at the computer , by the counter , in my old apartment , surfing the internet , when i came across a site with ads for horses for sale . i was perusing the ads , trying to figure out how much the prices had changed , making calculations , seeing if i could afford it , when i saw the ad . julie . for sale . 10 years old . secretariat bloodlines . my blood ran cold . the ad was from november . it was may when i saw it . i shot off an email in response to the ad , once i was able to stop crying . the response was brief but to the point . quot has been sold . quot obviously , this guy did not realize that he held my sanity and destiny in his hand . i sent a response , pleading for the new owner 's name and address , telling him her registered name , about the birthmark on her hip , anything i could think of to prove that i was legitimate . he was kind enough to send me the new owner 's mailing address , and i sent them a letter . we corresponded by email for two years . they were using her for dressage , and had bred her to a dutch warmblood stallion , so they were n't ready to sell . i was patient . on october 31 , 1999 , i got an email from her owners . they wanted to sell , they were giving me first option . history repeats itself in strange ways . i took a drive to cedar island , trying to think things over . i knew i was going to buy her , the question was . . . how . i had a job that paid decently , without which money would have been a bigger issue . but , that did n't erase the fact that i had n't ridden in 8 years , and was totally unprepared for horse ownership . i enrolled in riding lessons and starting making preparations for buying her . i saw her for the first time in 8 years on january 2 , 2000 , driving 16 hours roundtrip to haymarket , va after staying up all night for the y2k rollover at work . it was an unseasonably warm day . she was the same horse , alright . but she had n't been worked in a long time , and it was going to take a lot of work . but , my mind was made up years ago , and i would have bought her even if she had 3 legs and one eye . on february 26 , 2000 , i met her owners at a truck stop just north of the nc border for the exchange . julie came home with me . then the real adventure began .	horse

5596151217	positive	5596151217.jpg	the horse ( equus ferus caballus ) 2 3 is one of two extant subspecies of equus ferus , or the wild horse . it is a single hooved ( ungulate ) mammal belonging to the taxonomic family equidae . the horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi toed creature into the large , single toed animal of today . humans began to domesticate horses around 4000 bc , and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 bc . most horses today are domesticated and are members of the subspecies caballus , though there are still endangered populations of the przewalski 's horse , a separate subspecies , in the wild . przewalski 's horse is the only remaining true wild horse , as the more common populations of quot wild horses quot are feral horses which live in the wild but are descended from domesticated ancestors . there is an extensive , specialized vocabulary used to describe equine related concepts , covering everything from anatomy to life stages , size , colors , markings , breeds , locomotion , and behavior . horses' anatomy enables them to make use of speed to escape predators and they have a well developed sense of balance and a strong fight or flight instinct . related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down . female horses , called mares , carry their young for approximately 11 months , and a young horse , called a foal , can stand and run shortly following birth . most domesticated horses begin training under saddle or in harness between the ages of two and four . they reach full adult development by age five , and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years .	horse

6939974548	positive	6939974548.jpg	this last week i have been working with gemma in the saddle . we spent our first week of training doing ground games only and developing a partnership . the second week has been with the saddle on doing ground games , and then starting some in saddle work . when starting a young horse , it is really helpful to follow these steps 1 ) teach the horse the cues from the ground without any distractions do n't have the saddle or bridle on to start with because this can be too over whelming . just start in round pen with the basic tools of a rope halter , lead rope , and arm extension stick . try to pick a time with no or few distractions around the pen . 2 ) continue practicing with some distractions after the horse understands your cues , start to add some distractions to get a feel for how the horse will react . add the saddle , bridle , and maybe a distraction or two around the ring like a dog running around , some obstacles set up , etc . this will help the horse to get desensitized and become more confident . 3 ) start some in saddle work first start with just hopping up and down beside the saddle , putting pressure on the horse 's back . make sure the horse understands there is no need to get upset or worried . once the horse can stay calm and relaxed , then you can start practicing mounting and dismounting . 4 ) start some cues in the saddle , and use help if needed we want the experience to be positive and easy for the horse . start with simple cues that you have taught from the ground like that pulling back on the bridle means back up , or saying 'walk on' means walk on . if the horse gets confused , having someone lead you on the ground , or pony you while riding another horse can help the horse understand . i followed these steps with gemma with huge success . she is actually quite a calm and tolerant horse . she was completely still while i mounted and dismounted from both sides . she was confused when i asked her to walk on , so i had james help me by leading her forward . gemma was so relaxed about riding that we even did some trots while james led us around the ring . gemma was calm and willing about the whole ride . we finished with james leaving us on our own , and i asked gemma to walk on . when she did walk i gave her lots of praise . she did a couple very nice halt , back up , halt , and walk sequences that i gave her some praise and then dismounted . it is important to end on a positive note so when you come back to work with the horse again later it will be easier . key message this week remember to take it slow and easy for horse . if you are teaching something new try to remove the distractions and slowly add them in . try to always think how you can set it up to be an easy and positive experience for your horse !	horse

8727710663	positive	8727710663.jpg	the icelandic horse is a breed of horse developed in iceland . although the horses are small , at times pony sized , most registries for the icelandic refer to it as a horse . icelandic horses are long lived and hardy . in their native country they have few diseases icelandic law prevents horses from being imported into the country and exported animals are not allowed to return . the icelandic displays two gaits in addition to the typical walk , trot , canter and gallop commonly displayed by other breeds . the only breed of horse in iceland , they are also popular internationally , and sizable populations exist in europe and north america . the breed is still used for traditional farm work in its native country , as well as for leisure , showing , and racing . developed from ponies taken to iceland by scandinavian settlers in the 9th and 10th centuries , the breed is mentioned in literature and historical records throughout icelandic history the first reference to a named horse appears in the 12th century . horses were venerated in norse mythology , a custom brought to iceland by the country 's earliest settlers . selective breeding over the centuries has developed the breed into its current form . natural selection has also played a role , as the harsh icelandic climate eliminated many horses through cold and starvation . in the 1780s , much of the breed was wiped out in the aftermath of a volcanic eruption . the first breed society for the icelandic horse was created in iceland in 1904 , and today the breed is represented by organizations in 19 different nations , organized under a parent association , the international federation of icelandic horse associations . breed characteristics icelandic horses weigh between 330 and 380 kilograms ( 730 and 840 lb ) and stand an average of 13 and 14 hands ( 52 and 56 inches , 132 and 142 cm ) high , which is often considered pony size , but breeders and breed registries always refer to icelandics as horses . several theories have been put forward as to why icelandics are always called horses , among them the breed 's spirited temperament and large personality and the lack of a word in icelandic for quot pony quot . another theory suggests that the breed 's weight , bone structure and weight carrying abilities mean it can be classified as a horse , rather than a pony . the breed comes in many coat colors , including chestnut , dun , bay , black , gray , palomino , pinto and roan . there are over 100 names for various colors and color patterns in the icelandic language . they have well proportioned heads , with straight profiles and wide foreheads . the neck is short , muscular , and broad at the base the withers broad and low the chest deep the shoulders muscular and slightly sloping the back long the croup broad , muscular , short and slightly sloping . the legs are strong and short , with relatively long cannon bones and short pasterns . the mane and tail are full , with coarse hair , and the tail is set low . the breed is known to be hardy and an easy keeper . the breed has a double coat developed for extra insulation in cold temperatures . characteristics differ between various groups of icelandic horses , depending on the focus of individual breeders . some focus on animals for pack and draft work , which are conformationally distinct from those bred for work under saddle , which are carefully selected for their ability to perform the traditional icelandic gaits . others are bred solely for horsemeat . some breeders focus on favored coat colors . members of the breed are not usually ridden until they are four years old , and structural development is not complete until age seven . their most productive years are between eight and eighteen , although they retain their strength and stamina into their twenties . an icelandic mare that lived in denmark reached a record age of 56 , while another horse , living in great britain , reached the age of 42 . the horses are highly fertile , and both sexes are fit for breeding up to age 25 mares have been recorded giving birth at age 27 . the horses tend to not be easily spooked , probably the result of not having any natural predators in their native iceland . icelandics tend to be friendly , docile and easy to handle , although also enthusiastic and self assured . as a result of their isolation from other horses , disease in the breed within iceland is mostly unknown , except for some kinds of internal parasites . the low prevalence of disease in iceland is maintained by laws preventing horses exported from the country being returned , and by requiring that all equine equipment taken into the country be either new and unused or fully disinfected . as a result , native horses have no acquired immunity to disease an outbreak on the island would be likely to be devastating to the breed . this presents problems with showing native icelandic horses against others of the breed from outside the country , as no livestock of any species can be imported into iceland , and once horses leave the country they are not allowed to return . gaits the icelandic is a quot five gaited quot breed , known for its sure footedness and ability to cross rough terrain . as well as the typical gaits of walk , trot , and canter gallop , the breed is noted for its ability to perform two additional gaits . although most horse experts consider the canter and gallop to be separate gaits , on the basis of a small variation in the footfall pattern , icelandic breed registries consider the canter and gallop one gait , hence the term quot five gaited quot . the first additional gait is a four beat lateral ambling gait known as the t lt . this is known for its explosive acceleration and speed it is also comfortable and ground covering . there is considerable variation in style within the gait , and thus the t lt is variously compared to similar lateral gaits such as the rack of the saddlebred , the largo of the paso fino , or the running walk of the tennessee walking horse . like all lateral ambling gaits , the footfall pattern is the same as the walk ( left hind , left front , right hind , right front ) , but differs from the walk in that it can be performed at a range of speeds , from the speed of a typical fast walk up to the speed of a normal canter . some icelandic horses prefer to t lt , while others prefer to trot correct training can improve weak gaits , but the t lt is a natural gait present from birth . there are two varieties of the t lt that are considered incorrect by breeders . the first is an uneven gait called a quot pig 's pace quot or quot piggy pace quot that is closer to a two beat pace than a four beat amble . the second is called a valhopp and is a t lt and canter combination most often seen in untrained young horses or horses that mix their gaits . both varieties are normally uncomfortable to ride . the breed also performs a pace called a skei , flugskei or quot flying pace quot . it is used in pacing races , and is fast and smooth , with some horses able to reach up to 30 miles per hour ( 48 km h ) not all icelandic horses can perform this gait animals that perform both the t lt and the flying pace in addition to the traditional gaits are considered the best of the breed . the flying pace is a two beat lateral gait with a moment of suspension between footfalls each side has both feet land almost simultaneously ( left hind and left front , suspension , right hind and right front ) . it is meant to be performed by well trained and balanced horses with skilled riders . it is not a gait used for long distance travel . a slow pace is uncomfortable for the rider and is not encouraged when training the horse to perform the gait . although most pacing horses are raced in harness using sulkies , in iceland horses are raced while ridden . history the ancestors of the icelandic horse were probably taken to iceland by viking age scandinavians between 860 and 935 ad . the norse settlers were followed by immigrants from norse colonies in ireland , the isle of man and the western isles of scotland . these later settlers arrived with the ancestors of what would elsewhere become shetland , highland , and connemara ponies , which were crossed with the previously imported animals . there may also have been a connection with the yakut pony , and the breed has physical similarities to the nordlandshest of norway . other breeds with similar characteristics include the faroe pony of the faeroe islands and the norwegian fjord horse . about 900 years ago , attempts were made to introduce eastern blood into the icelandic , resulting in a degeneration of the stock . in 982 ad the icelandic althing ( parliament ) passed laws prohibiting the importation of horses into iceland , thus ending crossbreeding . the breed has now been bred pure in iceland for more than 1 , 000 years . the earliest norse people venerated the horse as a symbol of fertility , and white horses were slaughtered at sacrificial feasts and ceremonies . when these settlers arrived in iceland , they brought their beliefs , and their horses , with them . horses played a significant part in norse mythology , and several horses played major roles in the norse myths , among them the eight footed pacer named sleipnir , owned by odin , chief of the norse gods . skalm , a mare who is the first icelandic horse known by name , appeared in the book of settlements from the 12th century . according to the book , a chieftain named seal thorir founded a settlement at the place where skalm stopped and lay down with her pack . horses also play key roles in the icelandic sagas hrafnkel 's saga , njal 's saga and grettir 's saga . although written in the 13th century , these three sagas are set as far back as the 9th century . this early literature has an influence today , with many riding clubs and horse herds in modern iceland still bearing the names of horses from norse mythology . horses were often considered the most prized possession of a medieval icelander . indispensable to warriors , war horses were sometimes buried alongside their fallen riders , and stories were told of their deeds . icelanders also arranged for bloody fights between stallions these were used for entertainment and to pick the best animals for breeding , and they were described in both literature and official records from the commonwealth period of 930 to 1262 ad . stallion fights were an important part of icelandic culture , and brawls , both physical and verbal , among the spectators were common . the conflicts at the horse fights gave rivals a chance to improve their political and social standing at the expense of their enemies and had wide social and political repercussions , sometimes leading to the restructuring of political alliances . however , not all human fights were serious , and the events provided a stage for friends and even enemies to battle without the possibility of major consequences . courting between young men and women was also common at horse fights . natural selection played a major role in the development of the breed , as large numbers of horses died from lack of food and exposure to the elements . between 874 and 1300 ad , during the more favorable climatic conditions of the medieval warm period , icelandic breeders selectively bred horses according to special rules of color and conformation . from 1300 to 1900 , selective breeding became less of a priority the climate was often severe and many horses and people died . between 1783 and 1784 , around 70 of the horses in iceland were killed by volcanic ash poisoning and starvation after the 1783 eruption of lakag gar . the eruption lasted eight months , covered hundreds of square miles of land with lava , and rerouted or dried up several rivers . the population slowly recovered during the next hundred years , and from the beginning of the 20th century selective breeding again became important . the first icelandic breed societies were established in 1904 , and the first breed registry in iceland was established in 1923 . icelandics were exported to great britain before the 20th century to work as pit ponies in the coal mines , because of their strength and small size . however , those horses were never registered and little evidence of their existence remains . the first formal exports of icelandic horses were to germany in the 1940s . great britain 's first official imports were in 1956 , when a scottish farmer , stuart mckintosh , began a breeding program . other breeders in great britain followed mckintosh 's lead , and the icelandic horse society of great britain was formed in 1986 . the number of icelandic horses exported to other nations has steadily increased since the first exports of the mid 19th century . since 1969 , multiple societies have worked together to preserve , improve and market these horses under the auspices of the international federation of icelandic horse associations . today , the icelandic remains a breed known for its purity of bloodline , and is the only horse breed present in iceland . the icelandic is especially popular in western europe , scandinavia , and north america . there are about 80 , 000 icelandic horses in iceland ( compared to a human population of 317 , 000 ) , and around 100 , 000 abroad . almost 50 , 000 are in germany , which has many active riding clubs and breed societies . uses icelandic horses still play a large part in icelandic life , despite increasing mechanization and road improvements that diminish the necessity for the breed 's use . the first official icelandic horse race was held at akureyri in 1874 , and many races are still held throughout the country from april through june . both gallop and pace races are held , as well as performance classes showcasing the breed 's unique gaits . winter events are often held , including races on frozen bodies of water . in 2009 such an event resulted in both horses and riders falling into the water and needing to be rescued . the first shows , focused on the quality of animals as breeding stock , were held in 1906 . the agricultural society of iceland , along with the national association of riding clubs , now organizes regular shows with a wide variety of classes . some horses are still bred for slaughter , and much of the meat is exported to japan . farmers still use the breed to round up sheep in the icelandic highlands , but most horses are used for competition and leisure riding . ijslanders of ijslandse paarden worden al meer dan duizend jaar raszuiver gefokt . rasomschrijving het hoofd van de ijslander kan vari ren tussen heel edel en heel groot . de hals is kort en dik . het lichaam is gedrongen . de benen en de hoeven zijn heel sterk . het behang ( beenbeharing ) behoort overvloedig aanwezig te zijn . het gezichts en het ori ntatievermogen zijn goed ontwikkeld . de stokmaat ( schofthoogte ) varieert van 1 , 30 tot 1 , 45 meter . natuurlijk bestaan hierop uitzonderingen . geschiedenis toen aan het einde van de 9e eeuw de eerste inwoners op ijsland kwamen wonen , waren daar geen paarden . de vikingen namen paarden en andere huisdieren mee uit de gebieden waar ze vandaan kwamen , vooral uit noorwegen maar ook van de schotse eilanden . uit onderzoek blijkt dat de paarden van de vikingen van verschillende oorsprong waren en zelfs dat ze uit verschillende subgroepen van equus caballus afkomstig zijn . zo lijkt de verwantschap met noorse paarden , oorspronkelijk afkomstig uit noordelijk eurazi , overduidelijk . met name is de gelijkenis met het uiterst zeldzame nordland paard opvallend en enkele van deze paarden schijnen ook te kunnen t lten . ook een belangrijke voorouder van de ijslander is de keltische pony , oorspronkelijk meegenomen door de kelten westwaarts door europa en dus ook naar de britse eilanden . verschillende paardenrassen in groot brittanni stammen af van deze voorouder , zoals de shetlanders , exmoors en ook minder bekende rassen op de eilanden bij schotland . hoewel het invoeren van paarden na de 13e eeuw uiterst zeldzaam was , is er pas sinds 1882 sprake van een wettelijk invoerverbod op paarden en andere huisdieren in ijsland . voor die tijd was er geen noodzaak om het importeren te verbieden want eeuwenlang was het eiland uiterst ge soleerd en waren transportmiddelen zeldzaam . het was pas in de negentiende eeuw dat ijslanders weer schepen gingen bouwen en meer contacten gingen zoeken met de buitenwereld . hoogstwaarschijnlijk zijn er ook vanaf de twaalfde eeuw tot de negentiende eeuw geen paarden meer naar ijsland ge mporteerd . een van de bekendste misverstanden rond de geschiedenis van het ijslandse paard is waarschijnlijk de mythe dat er al in de tijd van de vikingen een invoerverbod op paarden naar ijsland bestond . dat er geen invoerverbod blijkt te zijn geweest , verandert niets aan het feit dat ijslandse paarden al honderden jaren zonder bloedvermenging van buitenaf zijn gefokt . zo komt het dat het ijslandse paard een regelrechte afstammeling is van het europese oerpaard equus stenonsis . deze paarden verspreidden zich in scandinavi en groot brittanni en kwamen uiteindelijk op ijsland terecht . de ijslanders stammen van deze paarden af . de ijslandse boeren hebben hun paarden raszuiver doorgefokt , maar ook op het continent van europa en in de verenigde staten zijn er mensen die dit oeroude ras zuiver willen houden en verbeteren . het tegenwoordige invoerverbod in ijsland geldt ook voor inheemse paarden die zijn ge xporteerd . een ijslands paard dat bijvoorbeeld naar een kampioenschap in het buitenland is afgevaardigd , zal na afloop verkocht moeten worden door zijn ruiter , die hem niet mee terug mag nemen naar ijsland . bijzonderheden typen de ijslander is eeuwenlang gebruikt als rijpaard en als pakpaard , onder andere voor het vervoer van de post , voor het bijeendrijven van schapen en als vervoermiddel voor de mens , maar ook recenter als sportpaard bij gangenwedstrijden en races . op het europese vasteland zijn veel van de ijslandse mogelijkheden overgenomen en elementen zijn toegevoegd . in europa worden gangenwedstrijden gereden . ook wordt er gereden met handpaarden en worden afstandsritten gemaakt . de ijslanders worden ook ingespannen voor de wagen en voor de slee . hoewel er beslist vele rassen zijn die er meer talent voor hebben , kan men met een ijslander een sprongetje wagen . het rijden van dressuur blijft de basis voor het rijden van de gangen en het beheersen van het paard in het algemeen . de ijslander is een zeer leergierig paard . ze zijn heel vriendelijk , maar ook heel eigenwijs . om deze reden zijn het geen echte quot kinderpony 's quot . wel zijn goed opgevoede ijslanders heel sensibel en vaak ook erg voorwaarts . het rijden op deze paarden vraagt daarom , vooral in het begin enige begeleiding . de hulpen worden bij voorkeur licht en vriendelijk gegeven . de ijslander is in staat om van verre de weg naar huis terug te vinden . bijzonderheden gangen in tegenstelling tot de meeste paarden , die slechts in de drie basisgangen stap , draf en galop kunnen gaan , kan een ijslander zich in vier en soms vijf verschillende gangen voortbewegen . deze extra gangen heten t lt en telgang . het zijn natuurlijke gangen die veulens van enkele uren oud al tonen . de ijslander is niet het enige ras dat over deze extra gangen beschikt . vele paarden van allerlei min of meer bekende rassen bewegen zich voort in t lt en telgang . bij ijslanders is alleen de snelle telgang , de rentelgang , gewenst . de langzame variant wordt niet gewaardeerd en wordt vaak met schweinepass aangeduid . de gangenaanleg verschilt per paard . er wordt gesproken van vier of vijfgangers en natuurt lters . viergangers zijn paarden die naast de stap , draf en galop ook kunnen t lten . deze paarden hebben vaak de draf als voorkeursgang . vijfgangers zijn paarden die naast de andere gangen ook over telgangaanleg beschikken . echter , niet elke vijfganger heeft het temperament om goed te kunnen rentelgangen . natuurt lters zijn paarden die zo gemakkelijk in t lt lopen , dat deze gang ook voor beginnende ruiters makkelijk te rijden is . voor ruiters en hun ijslandse paarden worden ook specifieke gangenwedstrijden uitgeschreven . hier worden proeven uitgeschreven die plaatsvinden op een ovaalbaan . ook zijn er snelheidsonderdelen , zoals telgangraces . de wedstrijden vinden plaats op regionale , nationale en internationale schaal . elke twee jaar vindt er een wereldkampioenschap voor ijslandse paarden plaats . in 2007 werd dit wk gehouden in nederland , in oirschot . het laatste wk werd in 2011 gehouden in oostenrijk . t lt de voetvolgorde van t lt is gelijk aan die van stap . het verschil zit in het optillen en neerzetten van de hoeven . gevolg hiervan is dat het paard in stap afwisselend op twee of op drie benen staat en in t lt op twee benen of op n been tegelijk steunt . een ijslander kan in t lt verschillende tempo 's lopen dit varieert van een langzame draf tot een flinke galop . doordat er in t lt geen zweefmoment bestaat , zoals in draf , ervaart de ruiter ook nooit ( onaangename ) opwaartse bewegingen en kan men ontspannen in het zadel blijven zitten . in t lt draagt het paard zijn hoofd en hals hoog . er ontstaat een trotse beweging , versterkt door het ritmisch meedansen van de staart . het gewicht wordt voornamelijk door de achterhand gedragen , zodat de voorbenen en schouders vrij kunnen bewegen . bij zeer goede t lters gaat dit gepaard met een hoge knieactie . behalve spectaculair is de t lt op de eerste plaats een comfortabele gang , zowel voor het paard als voor de ruiter . om aan te tonen hoe rustig de ruiter in het zadel zit , wordt in t lt demonstraties vaak met n hand gereden , met in de andere hand een vol glas bier . telgang telgang zien we niet alleen bij ijslanders , maar ook bij andere dieren . zo loopt een hond aan de lijn vaak in telgang , kamelen en dromedarissen gaan uitsluitend in telgang en hetzelfde geldt voor giraffen . in tegenstelling tot de draf wordt niet het diagonale , maar het laterale benenpaar gelijktijdig opgetild . hierdoor ontstaat voor de ruiter een heen en weer schommelende beweging . telgang in een langzaam tempo heeft de naam 'schweinepass' en wordt niet gewaardeerd . alleen de echte rentelgang , waarbij hoge snelheden worden gehaald , wordt als een positieve eigenschap beschouwd . op wedstrijden worden telgangrennen gehouden over 150 en 250 meter . het record op 250 m staat op 21 , 4 seconden . ter vergelijking het galoprecord over 250 m is 17 , 3 seconden . de snelste hengst aller tijden in rentelgang is trausti van hall . tijd op 250 meter 21 , 7 seconden . de kwaliteit van de gangen van een ijslands paard hangt af van de erfelijke aanleg , de bouw en de training . sommige ijslanders hebben duidelijk meer 'laterale aanleg' dan andere er zijn ijslanders die uit zichzelf niet in draf gaan maar alleen in t lt ( natuurt lters genoemd ) of , vaak minder gewenst , alleen in een langzame telgang . met behulp van bepaalde trainingsmethoden of hulpmiddelen kunnen de gangen die het paard niet vanzelf aanbiedt , vaak alsnog ontwikkeld worden . helaas blijven er dan altijd nog enkele paarden over die de ijslandse gangen niet beheersen . deze dieren worden voor de fokkerij zo veel mogelijk uitgesloten , want de specifieke ijslandse gangen willen we in dit ras behouden . juist de ijslandse gangen geven immers een extra dimensie aan het houden en rijden van ijslandse paarden . als er wedstrijden op het ijs worden gereden dan krijgt de ijslander speciale nageltjes onder zijn hoefijzers . ze rijden de wedstrijden ook in de t lt . kleur binnen het ras zijn alle kleuren vertegenwoordigd , behalve appaloosa ( stippels ) .

14250024920	positive	14250024920.jpg	the village of la alberca is nestled in the northern slopes of la sierra de francia , close to the border with portugal . this terrain is called the dehesa , a remnant of the original forests that once covered europe . the la alberca that ruth and i experienced back in the 1960 's was a primitive place the roads reflected the ravages of time , cobble stones were loose or missing in the plaza mayor with its simple granite cross . the traditional houses surrounding the square were made of granite , stone and wooden beams , many with three floors , each with a different function . a quot burro quot or two wandered through the square when we were there , and then there was a privileged pig who trotted the alleyways of the village . i learned that each year on june 13th , the feast day of santo antonio , the villagers dedicated one piglet to their favorite saint , and released it into the streets to wander where it may . the pig was nurtured by all until the next january when it was sacrificed at the matanza . as you can imagine , it did not take much effort for ruth and me to imagine ourselves in medieval times , hundreds of years in the past . but before we romanticized too much , we realized that the rustic touches of their local way of life were not the choice of the villagers , or to entertain tourists , they were the result of poverty ( . . . ) . that la alberca was a living functioning town when we visited was a tribute to the resilience of the spanish people . i found it beautifully expressed by the villagers who , despite their hard life , took time to adorn with flowers the large wooden balconies of their ancient houses . when ruth and i returned to la alberca 10 years later , in the 1970 's , we could see the first hints of what prosperity could bring . there in the town plaza we saw piles of new cobblestones , with workmen artfully laying them , one by one , by hand . the aura of the town was one of optimism a time of rebuilding . the town had been declared a national heritage site , and tourism was beginning to bring a new face to the town . with my sons tim and jonathan , i returned to la alberca in 2005 . i decided to return to the old plaza mayor , to see what had happened to it over the ensuing years since my first visit . i found that the cobblestones were neatly laid out and in good repair . the 12th century granite cross was still at the center . tourists were mingling with the townspeople at the local cafes . the houses flanking the square were beautifully restored . there were no animals sheltered on the ground floor of the dwellings . quot this is quite a change quot , i thought to myself . then , at that moment , i saw a priest , with two altar boys piously making their way across the ancient plaza to the parish church , behind a raised processional cross . as the three disappeared from sight , a mule meandered by . on his back was a bundle of golden straw . it could have been hundreds of years ago . much has transpired since the civil war of 1936 , nevertheless when i see family working together for generations , the rural way of life , the church to me this is the essence of traditional spain . i feel no regrets . the traditional spain we have loved in the past is alive and well in our modern times . don harris the heart of spain lt a href quot http www . blog . tienda . com quot	house

14435512724	positive	14435512724.jpg	the village of la alberca is nestled in the northern slopes of la sierra de francia , close to the border with portugal . this terrain is called the dehesa , a remnant of the original forests that once covered europe . the la alberca that ruth and i experienced back in the 1960 's was a primitive place the roads reflected the ravages of time , cobble stones were loose or missing in the plaza mayor with its simple granite cross . the traditional houses surrounding the square were made of granite , stone and wooden beams , many with three floors , each with a different function . a quot burro quot or two wandered through the square when we were there , and then there was a privileged pig who trotted the alleyways of the village . i learned that each year on june 13th , the feast day of santo antonio , the villagers dedicated one piglet to their favorite saint , and released it into the streets to wander where it may . the pig was nurtured by all until the next january when it was sacrificed at the matanza . as you can imagine , it did not take much effort for ruth and me to imagine ourselves in medieval times , hundreds of years in the past . but before we romanticized too much , we realized that the rustic touches of their local way of life were not the choice of the villagers , or to entertain tourists , they were the result of poverty ( . . . ) . that la alberca was a living functioning town when we visited was a tribute to the resilience of the spanish people . i found it beautifully expressed by the villagers who , despite their hard life , took time to adorn with flowers the large wooden balconies of their ancient houses . when ruth and i returned to la alberca 10 years later , in the 1970 's , we could see the first hints of what prosperity could bring . there in the town plaza we saw piles of new cobblestones , with workmen artfully laying them , one by one , by hand . the aura of the town was one of optimism a time of rebuilding . the town had been declared a national heritage site , and tourism was beginning to bring a new face to the town . with my sons tim and jonathan , i returned to la alberca in 2005 . i decided to return to the old plaza mayor , to see what had happened to it over the ensuing years since my first visit . i found that the cobblestones were neatly laid out and in good repair . the 12th century granite cross was still at the center . tourists were mingling with the townspeople at the local cafes . the houses flanking the square were beautifully restored . there were no animals sheltered on the ground floor of the dwellings . quot this is quite a change quot , i thought to myself . then , at that moment , i saw a priest , with two altar boys piously making their way across the ancient plaza to the parish church , behind a raised processional cross . as the three disappeared from sight , a mule meandered by . on his back was a bundle of golden straw . it could have been hundreds of years ago . much has transpired since the civil war of 1936 , nevertheless when i see family working together for generations , the rural way of life , the church to me this is the essence of traditional spain . i feel no regrets . the traditional spain we have loved in the past is alive and well in our modern times . don harris the heart of spain lt a href quot http www . blog . tienda . com quot	house

16382149917	positive	16382149917.jpg	the lower market such as freedom square used to be called is the largest and probably the oldest square in brno . in addition to many beautiful houses from different epochs it is dominated by an early baroque plague column from 1689 , as well as the built in 2010 chronometer draws attention to itself . the black obelisk recalls the siege of brno by the swedish army . although the swedens with 30 , 000 men the brno soldiers greatly outnumbered , the city could withstand 112 days the attacks of the swedens . finally , the swedish besiegers decided to withdraw if they did not succeed to conquer the city until noon . the defenders louis raduit , georg jacob ogilvy and brother martin st eda now had the idea to let the church bells ring already an hour earlier ( at 11 . 00 clock ) . the swedes heard the bells and departed . the city was saved thanks to its excellent defenders and the commitment of the brno population . the legend said that the leader of the swedens , general torstensohn , was immortal . the only way to kill him would be a glass ball that had to be produced at midnight with a special magic ritual . a large number of marbles in the obelisk reminds today of this legend that sound regularly like a carillon . you can see the marbles on their way through the obelisk . first they appear at a point high up , which is named after the general torstensohn , before finding their way into the lower part , which stands for the brno citizens . exactly at 11 . 00 clock the brno high noon appear the marbles in one of the four lower caves , where they can be taken out and taken along as souvenirs . and hardly to believed you can also read the time on the chronometer . . . . the historic houses on this square were constantly rebuilt and many have their own story which , of course , also the development of the town takes into accout . der untere markt wie der freiheitsplatz fr her hie ist der gr te und wahrscheinlich lteste platz in br nn . neben vielen sch nen h usern aus den unterschiedlichen epochen wird er von einer fr hbarocken pests ule aus dem jahr 1689 dominiert , aber auch der im jahre 2010 errichtete chronometer zieht die blicke auf sich . der schwarze obelisk erinnert an die belagerung von br nn durch die schwedische armee . obwohl die schweden mit 30 . 000 mann den br nnern zahlenm ig weit berlegen waren , konnte die stadt 112 tagen den angriffen der schweden statthalten . schlie lich beschlossen die schwedischen belagerer abzuziehen , wenn es nicht gel nge die stadt bis mittag zu erobern . die verteidiger louis raduit de souches , georg jacob ogilvy und bruder martin st eda hatten nun die idee , die kirchenglocken bereits eine stunde fr her ( um 11 . 00 uhr ) l uten zu lassen . die schweden h rten die glocken und zogen ab . die stadt war dank ihrer hervorragenden verteidiger und dem einsatz der br nner bev lkerung gerettet . die legende besagte , dass der anf hrer der schweden , general torstenson , unsterblich war . die einzige m glichkeit ihn zu t ten w re eine glaskugel , die um mitternacht mit einem besonderen magischen ritual herzustellen sei . eine gro e zahl an glasmurmeln im obelisken erinnert heute an diese legende , die regelm ig wie ein glockenspiel klingen . man kann die murmeln auf ihren weg durch den obelisken sehen . sie erscheinen zuerst an einem punkt hoch oben , der nach dem general torstenson genannt ist , um dann ihren weg in den unteren teil zu finden , der f r die br nner b rger steht . genau um 11 . 00 uhr dem br nner mittag erscheinen die murmeln in einem der vier unteren h hlen , wo sie herausgenommen und als souvenir mitgenommen werden k nnen . und kaum zu glauben kann man am chronometer auch noch die zeit ablesen . die historischen h user auf diesem platz wurden laufend umgebaut und viele haben ihre eigene geschichte , die nat rlich auch der entwicklung der stadt rechnung tr gt . a href http www . ask enrico . com index . php brno bruenn ? start 9 rel nofollow www . ask enrico . com index . php brno bruenn ? start 9 a	house

2097771280	positive	2097771280.jpg	the man in the street conceives of hanham as the little straggling rows of houses on either side of the road at the end of the tram terminus . his sole acquaintance with its picturesque landscape is by the path across the fields by way of hanham hall to hanham mills . actually hanham is much bigger , and in olden days , as shown by its ancient map of 1670 , was divided into west and east . within these boundaries are to be found as interesting a collection of ancient houses , and as romantic legends as may be found in bristol . perhaps the house best known to visitors is the 'old blue bowl' lying some little distance beyond the terminus . whether this name has any connection with a festive bowl in use in olden days at hanham court or barrs court is an interesting speculation . local tradition ( wide of the mark ) affirms the house to be not only the oldest in kingswood forest , but the earliest public house in england . until its renovation some months since , the interior was an ideal setting for smock frocks and long clay pipes . the parlour boasted of a gigantic fireplace , with settles opposite , and a low roof supported by great oak beams . a diamond pane lattice window gave light to the room . not many years ago the market gardeners held gatherings here . the walls of the inn are four to five feet thick , built up of rubble only . the vault beneath is of great age , while below the bar room is a deep well , used within living memory for water . the village is reputed to have one of the oldest public houses in britain , the blue bowl thought to have started life as a tavern for roman soldiers . there is no firm evidence for the age of the pub but roman coins have been discovered nearby and st lyte wrote in 1480 that it was an old established hostelry . a pub since the 1300 's and noted in the doomsday book . oliver cromwell also stayed in the village , at the blue bowl inn , which was used as his regional headquarters . 1841 . william bailey 1853 . james olds 1861 70 . john goodenough 1871 74 . j . oram 1879 88 . isaac bateman 1891 1910 . joseph bateman 1923 39 . george elliott isaac bateman was also a haulier . b the blue bowl and the bristol delftware punchbowl b as you can see , the new owners of the blue bowl in hanham have given us an authentic pub sign for the first time in living memory . the picture of a bristol delftware punchbowl an exact copy of one in bristol museum is the nearest we 'll ever see to the one thought to have been displayed by the pub 's landlord potter , edward bye , at the end of the 17th century . in 1995 , when new owners , mill house inns , decided to change the name , everybody was up in arms . a petition went round letters flooded the press . the campaign even had a song , broadcast by radio bristol , which we sang outside the pub and then later , on hanham common . in 2001 , mill house inns brought the old blue bowl name back a wonderful demonstration of people power . local historian george elliott , the last of three generations to live at the blue bowl , is the ideal man to relate its recent history . both he and i have researched the pub 's history as accurately as possible . the blue bowl 's story , in fact , only goes back as far as the 17th century . there may well have been a roman tavern in hanham , because the remains of a romano british settlement have been found nearby . according to charles painter in his short history of hanham , a pub called the blue bowl could have occupied the present site in the 15th century . he quotes a contemporary book , giving a location just east of the grange in the high street . the year 1704 is the date of the will and probate inventory of edward bye , who worked at brislington pottery and died at the blue bowl . the inventory shows a one up , one down building full of pewter ware and beer barrels . t 's clearly an alehouse , and quite possibly the same tiny cottage that survived into the 20th century , before it was extended in 1926 . edward bye 's two sons became apprentice potters in 1698 , so i think this must be the earliest record of a family living in the blue bowl . other blue bowl publicans were james olds , john goodenough , isaac oram , isaac bateman and his brother joseph . the bateman family kept pubs all over the area for many years . john goodenough 's father , henry , was hanham 's last game keeper and the family were well known footballers . did cromwell ever stay at the pub ? that 's very unlikely . the parliamentary army , only in hanham for one night in august 1645 , would have most likely camped at sydenham meadow , near keynsham . monmouth 's men quite definitely camped there . as for the well known boxer jim belcher frequenting the blue bowl , there is nothing to back up this story . and as for the cock road gang , they certainly existed and chances are that such people used the pub . but the legend that gang member dick boy slept at the pub with his boots on for a quick getaway is just that a legend . none of the written material about him mentions the blue bowl . by brian iles hanham	house

9376585376	positive	9376585376.jpg	the ancient house , ipswich , also known as sparrowes house , is a grade i listed building dating from the 15th century located in the buttermarket area . in 1980 the building was acquired by ipswich borough council . the building sports detailed pargeting , and also elaborate wood carvings around the front of the house . four panels of pargeting show a tudor impression of the world . the continents africa , america , asia and europe are shown notably lacking australasia which was not discovered at the time . africa is represented by a naked man holding a spear , asia by a horse and a mosque like building , europe by a woman with a horse and castle , and america by a man with a dog at his feet . the front of the building as it can be seen today ( in a restored state ) , was not an original feature of the building it was later added by robert sparrowe between 1660 and 1670 . it bears the royal arms of king charles ii , and the words quot honi soit qvi mal y pense quot . this is old french for quot shame upon him who thinks evil of it quot , and is also the motto of the order of the garter . the earliest reference to the house can be found in the 14th century , when it was owned by the knight , sir richard of martlesham . in the 16th century the house was owned by a string of local merchants , including george copping , a draper and fishmonger , who acquired the property in 1567 . it was copping that commissioned the paneling of the ground floor room at the front of the house . he also built the 'long gallery' . the sparrowe family became the owners of the house in 1603 , and continued ownership for the next 300 years . the condition of the house by 1979 was so bad that it was in danger of collapsing . the foundations had sunk , among other structural problems . in addition to this , woodworm and dry and wet rot had set in , and the deathwatch beetle was rife . renovation began in 1984 , and no part of the building was untouched . foundations were underpinned , the rot amp infestations were eradicated , floors were strengthened , plasterwork was restored , windows were releaded and features were exposed . the renovation was not without its problems the foundations had sunk , but the heavy fireplaces had sunk at a different rate . over 260 tonnes of concrete was used in the foundations , and 11 tonnes of steel were used overall . a href http en . wikipedia . org wiki ancient house , ipswich rel nofollow en . wikipedia . org wiki ancient house , ipswich a	house

15786568051	positive	15786568051.jpg	the scientific reason the leaves turn colors . as summer ends and autumn comes , the days get shorter and shorter . this is how the trees quot know quot to begin getting ready for winter . during winter , there is not enough light or water for photosynthesis . the trees will rest , and live off the food they stored during the summer . they begin to shut down their food making factories . the green chlorophyll disappears from the leaves . as the bright green fades away , we begin to see yellow and orange colors . small amounts of these colors have been in the leaves all along . we just ca n't see them in the summer , because they are covered up by the green chlorophyll . the bright reds and purples we see in leaves are made mostly in the fall . in some trees , like maples , glucose is trapped in the leaves after photosynthesis stops . sunlight and the cool nights of autumn cause the leaves turn this glucose into a red color . the brown color of trees like oaks is made from wastes left in the leaves . it is the combination of all these things that make the beautiful fall foliage colors we enjoy each year .	leave

442253527	positive	442253527.jpg	calving season on the ranches of british columbia is in full swing . it is a busy time for all involved . these days , it is also a time of stress for the agricultural community in bc . depressed values at the cattle auctions over the past several years , in part from the bse scare temporarily eliminating access to american markets for canadian beef , has in many cases meant that ranches are operating at a loss . increasing costs of fuel also have meant operating costs have soared . it now costs much more to harvest a hay crop or to transport cattle to market . in the face of diminishing profit margins and increased costs , the ranching industry in bc is in big trouble . from a conservation perspective , this is also a bad thing . although cattle ranching can have negative impacts on the land if conducted improperly , by and large ranching is a ecologically benign practise . however , in this economic climate , ranchers are fighting to survive , and when they do n't , they have to sell the farm . the profile of a typical purchaser of a ranch , is a developer , who subdivides the land for residential or second home recreational property . thus the expansive 1000 acre or larger ranch is broken down , at best , to 40 acre pieces , each with it 's own house , driveway , lawn etc . at its worst , a much denser development of 2 acre or less lot sizes adjacent to a brand new golf course may replace the expanse of native prairie . in this way , the low elevation grasslands and open forests of bc are at risk of disappearing . a bad time to be a badger or a burrowing owl ! as ironic as it may seem at face value , buying beef might just be one of the better ecological choices in the grocery store ! particularly if one can choose locally raised , grass fed , organic meat . on the flip side , is also the reality that big agro businesses in brazil and elsewhere are converting rainforests and disposessing local farmers , not in the name of beef , but in the name of soy ! food for thought . tim	meat

6518903119	positive	6518903119.jpg	photo is from prairierivers . org sarah von alt , an animal rights activist working with mercy for animals supports the occupy movement . quot mfa stands in solidarity with anyone who works to help animals , and i appreciate that the occupy movement has included animals in its official declaration of the occupation of new york city specifically that corporate interests have 'profited off of the torture , confinement , and cruel treatment of countless nonhuman animals , and actively hide these practices . ' quot von alt said as the occupy movement continues to gain momentum , it is becoming more obvious that americans have grown weary of corporate power in politics and the resulting abuses of humans and nonhuman animals . quot while taking to the streets and participating in peaceful protests is one way to raise awareness about these important issues , each of us can start to remove our financial support from big ag by transitioning to a healthier , more sustainable plant based diet . since cows , pigs and chickens make up 99 out of every 100 animals exploited and killed in this country , in a very real way , they are the 99 , quot von alt said . you can find plenty of info about mercy for animals online , but here is von alt 's overview of the organization . quot mercy for animals is a national non profit organization dedicated to preventing cruelty to farmed animals and promoting compassionate food choices and policies . we encourage consumers to open their hearts and minds , and widen their circle of compassion beyond family , friends and their beloved companion animals to include all animals , quot von alt said . she said more than 99 percent of animal exploitation and abuse in this country is at the hands of the meat , dairy and egg industries . quot farmed animals may not be as cute or fluffy as our dogs and cats at home , but they have the same capacity to feel love , joy , and happiness , as well as sorrow , fear and pain . the best way to help end the needless suffering of cows , pigs , chickens and other farmed animals is simply to not eat them , quot von alt said . she said while mfa s primary focus is on the animals themselves , transitioning to a plant based diet has shown benefits to human health , as well as our environment . quot currently , the leading causes of death in the united states , including heart disease , some forms of cancer , stroke and diabetes have been conclusively linked to diets high in meat , dairy , eggs and other animal products , quot von alt said . the united nations , pew charitable trusts and other organizations have concluded that animal agriculture is a leading cause of every environmental problem we face from global greenhouse gas emissions to deforestation to air and water pollution . quot by transitioning to a healthy and humane vegan lifestyle , we can spare animals lives of immeasurable suffering and protect human health and the health of the planet , quot von alt said . in light of this , boycotts of factory farmed meat , dairy and eggs if not a boycott of them altogether would seem to make sense . quot choosing cruelty free , plant based alternatives to meat , dairy and eggs is a powerful way to put your ethics on the table and vote for a kinder world every time you sit down to eat . if you don t like that animals are made to suffer and die for your dinner good news ! you have options . leave the meat at the supermarket . you don t have to continue to financially support an industry that hurts animals , the planet and your health . you can now find vegan versions of almost all your favorite foods including veggie burgers , soy milk , and dairy free ice cream at nearly every grocery store and restaurant . it s never been easier to adopt a healthy and compassionate vegan diet , quot von alt said . i asked her about using marches as part of a movement for animal rights . quot mfa volunteers around the country routinely take part in parades , street fairs and festivals to raise awareness about the plights of farmed animals . this was mfa 's sixth year marching in pride parades around the country , and as in years past , the crowd response has been amazing . in fact , since mfa 's inception more than a decade ago , the parallels between the gay rights , animal rights and other social justice movements has been an important theme in our philosophy and message . as dr . martin luther king jr . said , 'no one is free when others are oppressed . ' quot she said in addition to marching in pride parades , mfa seeks to create positive social change by raising awareness about the plights of farmed animals and talking to consumers about the power of their food choices . quot in 2011 , mfa conducted more than 1 , 500 public outreach events including vegan feed ins , tabling events , leafletings and paid per view screenings . at paid per view screenings we pay people a dollar to watch a 4 minute clip from farm to fridge , an eye opening exploration behind the closed doors of the nation s largest industrial poultry , pig , dairy and fish farms , hatcheries , and slaughter plants . exposing consumers to the realities of modern animal agriculture is a powerful way to inspire change , quot von alt said . i asked von alt what specific local eateries and markets are better than some others in terms of how animals are treated . i did n't quite get the answer i was looking for but i plan to ask mfa 's rice the same question , hoping he names names in a good way . quot after learning about the cruelty involved in factory farmed products , many people think 'free range , ' 'cage free' or 'organic' meat , eggs and dairy products are the solution . while these products may be less cruel than the typical factory farm products , they still involve needless violence , suffering and death and should not be mistaken for cruelty free , quot von alt said . she said any time an animal , even a free range animal , is used as a commodity to be consumed or treated as a piece of property corners are cut and the animals lose . quot animals on 'free range' farms are still often forced to live in overcrowded conditions , are mutilated without painkillers ( castration , tail docking , debeaking etc . ) , denied veterinary care and ultimately shipped to slaughter to have their throats cut open , quot said von alt . this may indicate the challenge of forming alliances between animal liberationists and advocates of so called humane animal husbandry . this also calls to mind how animal liberation gets relatively little attention in both mainstream and non mainstream progressive media outlets , not to mention non progressive media outlets . at the time of posting this content , i'm waiting on a reply from mercy for animals regarding the points in this paragraph . von alt continued . quot at mercy for animals , we encourage people to remember that the only meaningful difference between a dog or a cat and a cow , pig or chicken is the way that we treat them . if you would n't eat your free range dog or cat , why would you eat any other animal who has the same passion for life ? quot von alt said if a person feels they are not quite willing or able to stop eating animals yet , it is more productive to begin by reducing the amount of meat , diary and eggs one consumes instead of falling for clever marketing schemes designed to make people feel better about paying more for some of the same types of cruelties . i'm currently looking for more details about such clever marketing schemes . i asked von alt about the possible role of civil disobedience in the animal liberation movement . quot once people become aware of the scale of violence and suffering being routinely inflicted on animals in name of commerce and greed , some understandably turn to civil disobedience to express their outrage and to garner attention on the issue particularly when the mainstream media seems unwilling to cover these issues otherwise . while we neither condone nor condemn non violent actions to help animals , mfa continues to work within the law to bring its message of compassion to the masses , quot von alt said . i plan to ask mfa 's rice about why his organization would not condone non violent actions to help animals , as von alt says above . without confirmation from rice , my guess is that von alt meant mfa does not condone illegal actions , even those that are non violent . i asked von alt to offer ideas about engaging with government so as to save or improve farm animals' lives . though removing our financial support from the meat , dairy and egg industries is an easy and powerful way for individual consumers to put their ethics on the table , we shouldn t stop there , said von alt . quot concerned citizens can also push their local , state and federal representatives to ban some of the cruelest factory farming practices . for example , mfa volunteers were instrumental in getting california proposition 2 passed a couple years ago to outlaw veal crates for baby calves , gestation crates for mother pigs and battery cages for egg laying hens . these types of intensive confinement systems , which don t even allow the animals to freely move or lie down comfortably for nearly their entire lives , are perhaps the cruelest forms of institutionalized animal abuse in existence . but by raising awareness among the voting public , prop 2 passed by a landslide and became the most popular ballot initiative in california history , quot von alt said . she said mfa also worked with concerned citizens in ohio to collect signatures to outlaw similarly cruel practices here . quot when it became obvious to the industry that the measure may be as popular as the one in california , they decided to come to the table and negotiated a deal with the governor and the animal protection movement to phase out veal crates and gestation crates , place a moratorium on building new battery cage egg facilities and outlawed strangulation as a form of euthanasia , quot von alt said . these issues are related to ohio 's livestock care standards board , which was created in early 2010 after the issue 2 ballot initiative passed in autumn of 2009 . von alt said while it is important to remember outlawing some cruel practices does not make these industries cruelty free , it does help to alleviate the suffering of literally hundreds of millions of animals each year . quot it is because of citizens who care enough to lobby their elected representatives , to write letters and make phone calls and collect signatures , that these types of initiatives have been so successful , quot von alt said . on the distinction between groups that work for animal rights and those that work for animal welfare , von alt said those perspectives are not mutually exclusive . quot mfa believes non human animals are irreplaceable individuals with morally significant interests and hence rights . this includes the right to live free from unnecessary suffering and exploitation . we can work toward improving the lives of animals and alleviating their suffering while at the same time being clear that animals should not be exploited at all . quot	meat

2968927430	positive	2968927430.jpg	one of the clearest nights in a long time . this is as good as the night shooting gets in portland , where the light pollution and the clouds often mess with star trails . the weather was perfect all day , windy , but not too windy , then it died down for the night . often the wind will cause light refraction as the different layers of heat get stirred around in the atmosphere , so even if it blows away the haze , you ca n't take photos . not tonight ! this is a stack of 61 , 30 second exposures , at f 4 . 5 , 400 iso , wb set to something like 4100k . i'm not sure what came first , the end of the interval timer loop bug ( if you 've tried long exposure interval timing you know what i mean ) or the dead battery i only had about half a battery charge when i started . note even at 18mm in dx , pointing the camera at about 100 degrees produces some nice distortion in what would actually be nearly perfect archs made by the stars . enjoy !	night

4400092731	positive	4400092731.jpg	frederic lawrence knowles a full moon in its full glow on the last day of 2009 . b quot the ring around the moon is caused by the reflection of moonlight ( which of course is reflected sunlight ) from ice crystals in the upper atmosphere . the shape of the ice crystals results in a focusing of the light into a ring . since the ice crystals typically have the same shape , namely a hexagonal shape , the moon ring is always the same size . quot b source a href http imagine . gsfc . nasa . gov rel noreferrer nofollow imagine . gsfc . nasa . gov a b quot on a clear night , for example , the light you see coming from the moon is coming straight from the moon . however if a thin cloud layer is found between the observer and the moon , the diffraction and dispersion of the moonlight actually casts a light larger than the original light source . this 'crown' of light around the sun or moon is called the corona . when the cloud droplets are very uniform in size , the diffracted light can cause the corona to be separated into its component colors , with blue light to the inside of the red light . these colors may repeat themselves , surrounding the moon with a series of colored rings , becoming fainter as each subsequent ring is located further from the moon . quot b source ww2010 . atmos . uiuc . edu december 31 , 2009 , a href http en . wikipedia . org wiki waikiki rel noreferrer nofollow waikiki beach a , oahu , hawaii . a href http www . flickr . com photos worldofarun map ? amp flat 21 . 2759 amp flon 157 . 8256 amp zl 1 amp map type sat amp order by recent from here a .	night

3661502433	positive	3661502433.jpg	this plant is a very interesting plant . when you look at it , it looks like an ordinary , hairy weed with attractive little flowers . it can be a very dangerous plant , however , because when you touch it with your bare skin , you will get a terrible sting , which is very painful . when you get this sting it can be so bad that you might need treatment for it . if it is a minor sting and you get home quick enough , you can put some anesthetic cream on it . the sting feels very much like a bee sting and can last for hours or days . the stinging sensation is caused by formic acid which covers the tiny hairs of the plant . believe it or not , stinging nettle can be very useful too . it has been used as a medicine in europe for over 2 , 000 years . it can be turned into a tea made from the leaves and stems . this tea has been used to stop bleeding . stinging nettle seems to have a lot of medical uses , but the nettle root is known to be a diuretic and to give relief from prostate problems . source a href http www . blueplanetbiomes . org stinging nettle . htm rel nofollow www . blueplanetbiomes . org stinging nettle . htm a apparently this plant also secretes serotonin can it put one in a happier mood ?	plant

4101813953	positive	4101813953.jpg	there are some plants that have really insignificant , sometimes almost indiscernible , flowers but come in to their own when autumn arrives and their fruits emerge . holly is one that comes to mind but the spindle is undoubtedly another . spindle is not an uncommon shrub , probably overlooked for much of the year . in summer it has tiny little creamy green four petalled flowers just a few millimetres across . in the autumn they produce these brilliant coral pink seed cases that could almost be flowers in their own right . then the seed cases split to reveal a bright orange fruit inside . quite unique amongst our wild flora and easy to pick out . spindle occurs mainly on our chalk downland and lime rich soils . it has thin twiggy branches , hence our use of the word 'spindly' for anything thin . the wood , however , is white in colour and hard and smooth in texture which led to it being used for traditional spindles that were used in spinning wool and cotton . it was also the primary plant for producing artist 's charcoal . altogether an interesting plant that is popular with insets too .	plant

4858981501	positive	4858981501.jpg	one of the great sights of the forests of eastern australia is happening right now . the australian red cedar is coming into new leaf . a deciduous mahogany which has a month or so without leaves in the dead of winter . around 150 years ago , men used to climb hills and mountains , and look below for the tell tale sign of new red or red orange growth of this plant . then they would plan to travel through the forests and cut down the red cedars . the lightweight reddish brown timber was prized for cabinet making , railway timber , boat building , turnery , parquetry , and so many other uses . some as ordinary as toilet seats and roofing . now , red cedar , i a href http plantnet . rbgsyd . nsw . gov . au cgi bin nswfl . pl ? page nswfl amp lvl sp amp name toona ciliata rel nofollow toona ciliata a i is considered the same species that grows in norfolk island , pakistan , new guinea , india and right down the south east coast of australia to near ulladulla . the southern most limit of distribution is apparently near the village of turmeil on the south coast of new south wales . it 's growing on basalt based soils west of the princes highway . in the mid 20th century , the cedar king of kempsey , bill haydon ran a lumber company in the mid north coast of new south wales . he made a good living exploring the ranges and the lowlands , cutting out red cedar . some of these trees were giants . several metres wide at the base . forty , fifty and more metres tall . trees over a thousand years old . there 's stories of monumental red cedar trees back of kempsey , now long gone . huge trees , majestic giants . who knows how tall they were , or how old they were . in april 1965 bill haydon disappeared in the wilderness of eastern australia . his remains were never found . his quest was to find red cedar , and cut them down and sell them for railway timber . that is for the insides of carriages . of internal paneling of trains . i 've traveled in them , and they are great carriages indeed . beautiful internal woodwork , a pale reddish colour . and on the walls of the train were black amp white photos of new south wales . great pictures to see , one i recall was the photo of mount warning , up in the far north east of the state . today , there is a stand of eleven red cedar at washpool national park . this is the last big stand . i the last big stand i of australian red cedar . perhaps , these were the trees that bill searched for . maybe his bones are nearby that stand of trees , maybe five miles away . it 's likely we will never know what happened to him . throughout the rainforests of eastern australia , the australian red cedar are waking from their winter sleep . now , the new leaves are engorged by fluid , they are spreading out , rich and red in their new colours . such as in this photo . the photo was taken at the a href http en . wikipedia . org wiki allyn river rel nofollow allyn river a in the barrington tops region of new south wales . the sub tropical rainforest by the allyn river is of some merit . such a diversity of many interesting plants . laurels , myrtles , figs and so many more . there 's large trees of varying types here . particularly the figs and a big rosewood . the big fig is 56 metres tall , it 's huge . logging at the allyn river started as early as the 1820s . the target was this tree , the australian red cedar . after recent rain , the allyn river is pouring down the valley slopes , and rushing through the agricultural land , on a journey to the sea .	plant

468886018	positive	468886018.jpg	yerterday in the morning i saw this beauty of flower in my garden , and i thought that my family nor me did not have to be the only ones in being able to enjoy its view . it is for that reason that i shoot several photos . all you see here is natural , without post processing . the water drops are because the rosebush was watered some minutes before . and b i give this rose to all my female friends of flickr because today is the day of sant jordi b . the bright , sunny color of yellow roses evokes a feeling of warmth and happiness . the warm feelings associated with the yellow rose are often akin to those shared with a true friend . as such , b the yellow rose is an ideal symbol for joy and friendship b . b la diada de sant jordi b , also known as el dia de la rosa ( the day of the rose ) or el dia del llibre ( the day of the book ) is a catalan holiday celebrated on april 23 similar to valentine 's day with some unique twists that show the ancient practice of this day . the main event is the exchange of gifts between sweethearts , loved ones and respected ones historically , men gave their girlfriends and wives roses , and women gave their boyfriends and husbands a book to celebrate the occasion . in modern times , the mutual exchange of books is customary . roses have been associated with this day since medieval times , but the giving of books is a more recent marketing ploy . in 1923 , a smart bookseller started to promote the holiday as a way to honour the nearly simultaneous deaths of miguel cervantes and william shakespeare on april 23 , 1616 . barcelona is the publishing capital in both catalan and spanish and this heady one two punch of love and literacy was quickly adopted . on barcelona 's principal street , la rambla , and all over the city , hundreds of stands of roses and makeshift bookstalls are hastily set up for the occasion . by the end of the day , some four million roses and 400 , 000 books will have been purchased in the name of love . you will be hard pressed to find a woman without a rose in hand , and half of the total yearly book sales in catalonia take place on this occasion . and while la diada de sant jordi is not an quot official quot holiday , most romantics ditch the office to stroll the beautiful streets of barcelona and to take in the sultry springtime weather . love is definitely in the air , but even if you do n't have a novio to smooch on a park bench there are still plenty of things to see and do . for example , the sardana , the national dance of catalonia , will be performed throughout the day in the pla a sant jaume . and many book stores and cafes host readings by noted authors ( look out for 24 hour marathon readings of cervantes' quot don quixote quot ) . and there will be a variety of street performers and musicians on hand to add a romantic ambience to nearly every public square and plaza . additionally , april 23rd is the only day of the year when the palau de la generalitat , barcelona 's principal government building , is open to the public . inside this gothic architectural masterpiece you 'll see huge displays of roses created to honour saint george .

( the truth is that quite few aspen photographs are just that partly because i'm always looking around for places i have n't photographed before , and partly because one never knows what the aspen conditions will like until arrival on the scene . ) i had started my morning with a plan that evolved a bit . up well before sunrise , my initial plan to was to explore an area of east facing slopes along the edge of the sierra where i knew that colorful trees would be scattered about . as i drove to what seemed like the obvious starting point , i thought about a very large grove that i had earlier spotted very high up on these slopes . . . and as i looked that direction i saw a set of headlights up there ! that was all the encouragement i needed to find a narrow a steep track that took me way up high on a ridge from which i photographed those trees at dawn . when i finished shooting there i took a few minutes to finally eat something and then figured that i would try a quot sure bet quot location nearby . i drove back down the single track gravel route , got back on pavement , and headed there . sure enough , there was a lot of brilliant color in this area . as i drove up the road i spotted rows of aspens at the edge of a meadow , still in soft shaded light , but not seeing a photograph there and with my mind on another subject up ahead , i kept going . before long i was done with that quot other subject quot and i decided to head toward a third ( and non aspen ) subject , so i turned around and headed back the way i came . as i passed this spot again , something about the light and the trees caught my attention again mainly the soft effect of light reflected into this shaded grove so i stopped and made a series of photographs that mostly just quot show what is quot about these trees . a href http www . gdanmitchell . com 2007 08 26 thoughts on my summer 2007 backpacking photography kit dan at shuksan 60squarecrop rel nofollow a a href http www . gdanmitchell . com rel nofollow em strong g dan mitchell strong em a is a california photographer and visual opportunist whose subjects include the pacific coast , redwood forests , central california oak grasslands , the sierra nevada , california deserts , urban landscapes , night photography , and more . a href http www . gdanmitchell . com rel nofollow blog a a href http www . gdanmitchell . com about rel nofollow about a a href http www . flickr . com photos gdanmitchell flickr a a href http twitter . com gdanmitchell rel nofollow twitter a a href http www . facebook . com gdanmitchell rel nofollow facebook a a href http plus . google . com gdanmitchellphotography posts rel nofollow google a a href http 500px . com gdanmitchell rel nofollow 500px . com a a href http www . linkedin . com in gdanmitchell rel nofollow linkedin a a href mailto dan gdanmitchell . com rel nofollow email a em text , photographs , and other media are copyright g dan mitchell ( or others when indicated ) and strong are not strong in the public domain and may strong not strong be used on websites , blogs , or in other media without advance permission from a href http www . gdanmitchell . com rel nofollow g dan mitchell a . em	tree

( the color comes to this high country area of zion while things are still mostly green back down in zion canyon . ) at this point em some em cottonwood and box elder trees were changing , though there was a lot of green still around . however , the red maples , which seem to change first , were at peak color conditions in many spots . as we drove along the park road , we were more or less hanging out the windows , looking for those combinations of light ( quality and angle ) , color ( or trees and rocks ) , and geology that might make good photographs . most often we found ourselves looking down into narrow canyons where colorful trees lined the banks of the stream beds . sometimes we photographed from above , but the most productive shooting involved hiking down into these canyons and then slowly walking them while looking intently for subjects . of course , the red maples do n't require a lot of careful looking ! this group of trees was in a shady curve in the bottom of a canyon , so i found a frame filling bunch of branches and leaves and made a few exposures . a href http www . gdanmitchell . com 2007 08 26 thoughts on my summer 2007 backpacking photography kit dan at shuksan 60squarecrop rel nofollow a a href http www . gdanmitchell . com rel nofollow em strong g dan mitchell strong em a is a california photographer whose subjects include the pacific coast , redwood forests , central california oak grasslands , the sierra nevada , california deserts , urban landscapes , night photography , and more . a href http www . gdanmitchell . com rel nofollow blog a a href http www . gdanmitchell . com about rel nofollow about a a href http www . flickr . com photos gdanmitchell flickr a a href http twitter . com gdanmitchell rel nofollow twitter a a href http www . facebook . com gdanmitchellphotography rel nofollow facebook a a href https plus . google . com u 0 102554407414282880001 rel nofollow google a a href http 500px . com gdanmitchell rel nofollow 500px . com a a href http www . linkedin . com in gdanmitchell rel nofollow linkedin a a href mailto dan gdanmitchell . com rel nofollow email a em text , photographs , and other media are copyright g dan mitchell ( or others when indicated ) and strong are not strong in the public domain and may strong not strong be used on websites , blogs , or in other media without advance permission from a href http www . gdanmitchell . com rel nofollow g dan mitchell a . em	tree
