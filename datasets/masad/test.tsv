7987556042	negative	7987556042.jpg	it s kind of strange . i had been in this room once before , and sat maybe three feet away from this very bird i photographed , yet had no idea he ( or she , but for all intensive purposes we ll go with he ) was even there . then , on a return trip two months later , i found myself in the room once again and noticed this little guy . over the course of editing this photo , i ve learned more and more about him and it really kind of took me by surprise . through bringing out the detail of the photograph , i brought out the detail of the last 72 ( give or take ) hours of his life . now i m no scientist or mortician , but the educated guesses i have come up with are he broke his back . most likely from flying around in the pitch black that this building becomes at night . my guess is he got trapped during the day , and was still frantically attempting to escape by the time night fell . he was not trapped long . the area that his remaining , mummified abdominal encasing engulfs is too plump to reflect starvation . he felt it . he was likely mid flight ( as mentioned before ) . parts of his upper wing are broken and his eyes are closed . unless he was in the middle of blinking , it s safe to assume a bird isn t going to be flying with his eyes closed . even in the pitch black . so he probably closed his eyes immediately at impact , once he felt what was happening . also , not pictured , his toes were curled . he braced for impact . what i ve learned from the photo aside , i especially loved how mr . bird here took me by surprise but i chose to bring him out in the photograph instead , so people can appreciate his presence instead of scrolling past and dismissing him as just another pile of asbestos ( like i initially did ) . i also loved how he really looks like he just fell asleep . that s what i thought originally , and that s how it really looks . like he curled up all by himself and rested his little head down and just fell asleep . those two aspects are what made me come up with the titles i chose . he fell asleep and has now become almost camouflaged , almost to never again make a peep . but i changed that a little bit , so this image will forever remain as his legacy is carted away with the rest of our beloved harlem . i guess you could say that s part of the reason i love photographing these buildings as much as i do . they ve gone to sleep and each stage they enter is like a stage of life and with each stage of life and death ( literal and figurative ) , every thing speaks . and as every stage passes , there s another message they keep the same messages i try to capture with my photography . to see the second installment of this picture series , proceed to a href http www . flickr . com photos kiddinz 7987547531 in photostream www . flickr . com photos kiddinz 7987547531 in photostream a	bird

8516978808	negative	8516978808.jpg	dungeness is a headland on the coast of kent , england , formed largely of a shingle beach in the form of a cuspate foreland . it shelters a large area of low lying land , romney marsh . dungeness is also the name of the power station and a few other nearby buildings near the beach , and of an important ecological site at the same location . dungeness is one of the largest expanses of shingle in the world . it is of international conservation importance for its geomorphology , plant and invertebrate communities and birdlife . this is recognised and protected mostly through its conservation designations as a national nature reserve ( nnr ) , a special protection area ( spa ) , a special area of conservation ( sac ) and part of the site of special scientific interest ( sssi ) of dungeness , romney marsh and rye bay . there is a remarkable variety of wildlife living at dungeness , with over 600 different types of plant a third of all those found in britain . it is one of the best places in britain to find insects such as moths , bees and beetles , and spiders many of these are very rare , some found nowhere else in britain . the short haired bumblebee , bombus subterraneus , was last found in the uk in 1988 , but has survived in new zealand after being shipped there more than 100 years ago . it is to be reintroduced at dungeness . it is planned that the first bees will be introduced in the spring of 2010 . the flooded gravel pits on denge beach , both brackish and fresh water , provide an important refuge for many migratory and coastal bird species . the rspb has a bird sanctuary there and every year thousands of bird watchers descend on the peninsula to catch a glimpse of a rare bird from the bird observatory . one of the most remarkable features of the site is an area known as 'the patch' or , by anglers , as 'the boil' . the waste hot water and sewage from the dungeness nuclear power stations are pumped into the sea through two outfall pipes , enriching the biological productivity of the sea bed and attracting seabirds from miles around . beach fishing is popular at dungeness , with the area being a nationally recognised cod fishing venue in the winter . the name dungeness derives from old norse nes quot headland quot , with the first part probably connected with the nearby denge marsh . popular etymology ascribes a french origin to the toponym , giving an interpretation as quot dangerous nose quot .	boat

5419813866	negative	5419813866.jpg	from a href http www . hauntedcastlesandhotels . com ireland leap . htm rel noreferrer nofollow www . hauntedcastlesandhotels . com ireland leap . htm a leap castle has a violent and turbulent history , a keep castle , it was built in the 14th or 15th century to guard the pass from slieve bloom into munster . this fortress is considered ireland 's most haunted castle , haunted by the type of spirit called an quot elemental quot . it is a frighting and horrifying apparition , it 's hauntings bring on an overwhelming sense of dread and deep rooted fear . those who have experienced it describe a hideous looking quot thing quot with almost human looking eyes and reeks of the most ghastly odor . history the galic name for the castle is quot leim ui bhanain quot , which means the leap of the o'bannons . under the o'carroll chiefs , the o'bannon clan were the first owners of leap castle , later occupied by the o'carroll 's themselves . from here the o'carroll 's would set out for victory and defeat , and here they would bring thier brides and there captives . leap was an impregnable fortress impervious to attack . in 1513 , leap castle was attacked by gerald fitzgerald , but was not taken . gerald og fitzgerald of kildore attacked the castle in 1516 . in 1557 during an attack led by the earl of sussex , the o'carroll 's made a successful escape . in 1604 or 1605 , some of ely o'carroll 's territory was attached to kings county which is now offaly . it is rumored that the daughter of an o'carroll helped the escape of a darby from leap castle and later married him . after the failure of the revolt of the earls , in 1619 the plantation of ely o'carroll took place . along with the english rulers , loyal protestant scots and englishmen settled into the area depriving the local galic population of their land . leap castle then passed into the hands of the darby family . after this many darbys became high sheriff of kings county . the most famous darby is admiral sir henry darby who fought at the battle of the nile and escorted napolean bonaparte into exile after leaving france . the elemental over 400 years ago in what is now known as the quot bloody chapel quot a shocking murder occured . leap castle was then a stronghold of the o'carroll family , powerful irish princes , chieftains of the area . in 1532 , on the death of the o'carroll chieftain , a fierce rivalary for the leadership errupted within the family . the bitter fight for power turned brother against brother . one of the brothers was a priest . the o'carroll priest was holding mass for a group of his family ( in what is now called the quot bloody chapel quot ) . while chanting the holy rites , his rival brother burst into the chapel plunging his sword into his brother . fatally wounding him , the butchered priest fell across the altar and died in front of his family . the henious act of brother killing brother and the blasphemy of a sacred mass cut short by such an evil event sent an echo of misery ringing thoughout the castle . another source of evil was found at leap castle that may have compounded and nutured the spirt of the elemental . a hidden ubliet ( a dungeon ) was found off the bloody chapel . it was a small room with a drop floor . those who were forgotten within this room suffered unimaginable pain and misery until their death . prisoners would be pushed into the room to fall through the floor and land on a spike eight feet below . if you were not lucky enough to die quickly on the spike , you died of starvation in a doorless room while the aroma of food and the sounds of merriment drifted up from the rooms below . a narrow window would let you watch those who came and went in freedom from the castle . around c . 1900 workmen who where hired to clean out the ubliet made a hideous discovery , human skeletons laid piled on top of each other . it took three full cart loads to remove all of the bones . among the bones workmen found a pocket watch made in the 1840 's . it is not certain if the dungeon was still in use then . because of its extremely bloody history leap castle has always had a reputation of being haunted , a reputation so strong local people avoided it at night . completely gutted by fire , leap castle was boarded up and it 's gates were pad locked for over 70 years . locals have described seeing the windows at the top of the castle quot light up for a few seconds as if many candles were brought into the room quot late at night . the castle laid in ruin for years . shortly after leap 's dungons gruesome discovery , a psychic disturbance may have caused the emergence of the elemental spirit . in 1659 ownership of leap castle passed in marrage from the o'carroll family to an english family , the darbys . the darby family turned leap into their family home , with improvements and additions and landscaped gardens . in the late 19th century descendants johanthan and mildred darby were looking forward to raising their family here . the occult was the fashion of the day , and mildred darby did some innocent dabbling , despite the castle 's history and reputation for being haunted . mildred 's dabbling with magic awakened the elemental with ferocious velocity . in 1909 , mildred darby wrote an atricle for the journal occult review , describing her terrifying ordeal . quot i was standing in the gallery looking down at the main floor , when i felt somebody put a hand on my shoulder . the thing was about the size of a sheep . thin guanting shadowy . . . , it 's face was human , to be more accurate inhuman . its lust in its eyes which seemed half decomposed in black cavities stared into mine . the horrible smell one hundred times intensified came up into my face , giving me a deadly nausea . it was the smell of a decomposing corpse . the elemental is thought to be a premative ghost that attaches itself to a particular place . it is often malevolent , terrifying and unpredictable . after mrs . darby 's experiments in the black arts , leap castle has never been the same . hauntings plague leap leaving a sinister air throughout the castle . the darbys remained at leap until 1922 . being the home of an english family , it became the target of the irish struggle for independence . destroyed by bombs , completely looted , nothing but a burned out shell remained . the darby 's were driven out . in the 1970 's leap castle was purchased by an australian , who had a white witch brought in from mexico to exorcise the castle . she spent many hours in the bloody chapel , when she emerged she explained that the spirits at leap castle were no longer malevolent , but they wished to remain . in the 1990 's the castle was sold to the current owners . they were aware of the castle 's troubled history . shortly after moving in they began restoration of the castle . during which time a quot freak accident quot left the owner with a broken kneecap delaying restoration work on the castle for nearly a year . one year after his quot accident quot the owner was back at work restoring his castle when the ladder he was standing on suddenly tilted backwards away from the wall causing him to jump several stories resulting in a broken ankle . both were strange accidents . the owners say they would be happy to share the castle with the spirits as long as there are no more quot occurrences quot . in 1991 , in leap castle 's bloody chapel was the christening of the owner 's baby daughter . for the first time in centuries the quot bloody chapel quot was filled with music , dancing , laughter , and most of all love . the day had been a quot happy , pleasant , wonderful day quot . if the troubled spirits of leap castle did not leave , maybe they have finally found some peace .	castle

15531432412	negative	15531432412.jpg	we are all but certain of the identification of this mushroom , but we wo n't eat it because it 's possible to mistake for it one of the world 's most deadly mushrooms ( and one of california 's few deadly ones ) , amanita phalloides . reportedly both these amanitas are delicious , and the one that destroys your liver does n't produce symptoms for about 8 hours , plenty of time to say quot wow , that 's good , i 'll have a little more . quot so we admire it in the woods , and leave it there . and seeing several of these nearby led me to re think the possibility of training roo to be a mushroom hunter . maybe there 's enough difference in smell that she 'd never make a mistake , and probably we could teach her never to touch any of them , just point them out to us , and let her find boletes ( no mistaking those ) . but i think we just wo n't take the chance .	mushroom

2749184782	negative	2749184782.jpg	b capt suresh sharma . all rights reserved b i have just come back to base , after a short but exhilarating trip to hot and searing rajasthan state of india . its the most sought after destination by the western tourists . i got an invitation from my regiment to join them in the desert , with sand baking every living thing at 45 degrees celsius . we were all in tents , but this year unprecedented rains saved everyone from the usual heat of rajasthan . they were out for their routine training in desert . it was a great time , which i spent meeting my old colleagues . i do n't know about other armies , but the indian army has a unique culture full of special traditions . like all other veterans of the indian army , i will keep visiting my regiment as and when i get opportunity . in the indian army , old soldiers veterans have great place and are respected much more than when they were serving . even my kids , after i leave this world , will be welcomed to the regiment and will keep getting invitation on special occasions of the regiment i . e . raising day celebrations , etc . on such occasions , both sides feel honoured , veterans as well as the serving soldiers of the regiment , always a great event of all the regiments of the indian army . while soldiers of my regiment were shooting with guns , i was busy shooting them with my cameras , as i promised to my regiment to design its special greeting card and calender . so , i had great a great time shooting the guns with my cameras . i felt great ! ! no words can express my joy , as it was a great re union . i was wondering how quickly 24 years have gone past , on 25th august 1984 i was commissioned into 93 field regiment of the indian artillery . as i was with one of the gpos ( gun position officers ) and when the first shell of the day was fired from one of the guns , the memories of my gpo days flashed back in a split second and turned me quite emotional for a while . it was as if i was yelling `fire orders' through ages old megaphone ( a tin sheet conical contraption to make the orders louder ) myself as gpo on my first firing in 1984 , so fresh were the memories . the india gunners have great traditions , when a newly appointed gpo ( gun position officer ) , in my days it was 2lt and now its lt ( full lieutenant ) comes out to the firing ranges , suddenly he is the king of the gun position . when a new gpo yells out his first ever fire orders quot fire quot , no gunner will fire the gun and there will be a pin drop silence , then the gpo has to first yell out quot 5 boxes of rum bottles quot ( it can be any number of rum boxes ) . and within a split second the first round bangs out into the sky . the moment breach block of the smoking gun opens to eject the used brass cartridge , which is hot and smoking at this moment , the no . 1 ( leader of the gun detachment ) picks up the hot brass cartridge and rushes to the gpo and gifts him the hot brass case . on this occasion , all the soldiers of the six guns and the command post will yell out their regimental war cry . in my regiment , they will shout quot velluvam velluvam , vetrikunde sellvam quot , which means quot we will win , we will win and we will only win quot . once this outdoor training session , which is called `annual practice camp' , is over then all the soldiers of that gpo will invite him to their dinning hall . it will be celebration time for the gunners with their new gpo . they fill up the first brass cartridge , which the gpo had got as it was his first round of fire , with rum and all will get a sip each from the cartridge . these unwritten traditions of the indian army , keep them altogether as a family and strongly bonded all the time . b since there were good rains in desert this time , it was time for many things to mushroom ! ! ! while there was a lull in firing in the `gun area' , i found many white mushrooms there and did a photo session . b	mushroom

6766651647	positive	6766651647.jpg	the tomato is native to south america . genetic evidence shows the progenitors of tomatoes were herbaceous green plants with small green fruit and a center of diversity in the highlands of peru . one species , solanum lycopersicum , was transported to mexico , where it was grown and consumed by mesoamerican civilizations . the exact date of domestication is not known . the first domesticated tomato may have been a little yellow fruit , similar in size to a cherry tomato , grown by the aztecs of central mexico . the word quot tomato quot comes from the nahuatl word tomatl , literally quot the swelling fruit quot . spanish explorer cort s may have been the first to transfer the small yellow tomato to europe after he captured the aztec city of tenocht tlan , now mexico city , in 1521 , although christopher columbus , a genoese working for the spanish monarchy , may have taken them back as early as 1493 . the earliest discussion of the tomato in european literature appeared in an herbal written in 1544 by pietro andrea mattioli , an italian physician and botanist , who named it pomo d oro , or quot golden apple quot . aztecs and other peoples in the region used the fruit in their cooking it was cultivated in southern mexico and probably other areas by 500 bc . the pueblo people are thought to have believed that those who witnessed the ingestion of tomato seeds were blessed with powers of divination .

16185164932	positive	16185164932.jpg	this is sort of a redemption bird for me . sage thrashers are not common in illinois , in fact this is only the seventh time one has been reported in the state since records have been kept on such things . so , it was definitely worth driving a couple of hours in the pre dawn darkness to find this bird . i term it a quot redemption bird quot because one was reported at montrose a couple of years ago and i could not get out to see it in time . of course i went there the day after it was last seen . with that being said i headed off to putnam county , il to find this more recently reported bird . the directions on the birding websites were very precise and i had no trouble finding the area that the bird has been frequenting . before the sun rose i walked along the line of trees looking for a fruiting juniper and i found the bird right away . all i had to do now was wait for the light . i took a couple of record shots at iso 4000 just to have something in case the bird decided to leave , thankfully that would not be an issue . it flew off to a small patch of woods a couple of times but kept returning to this same juniper tree . for a bird species that has a bit of reputation for being skittish around people , this individual was very relaxed and approachable . an awesome bird and a wonderful experience !	bird

6841102014	positive	6841102014.jpg	i booked a week off work this week , and yesterday looked the ideal day to go birding . after seeing the fantastic peregrine photos taken by some of my flickr contacts , a friend and i decided to try dover cliffs for these awesome birds . a 4 30am start to meet my friend and a 1 hour 30 minute drive to dover in thick fog , we arrived at the mist covered cliffs , however the sun was shining . having no real idea of where to look , we just wandered along the cliffs . scanning down , to my delight a peregrine was circling around the gulls , giving me my best views of this species to date and we had only been there for a half hour . shortly afterwards , we spotted a bird sitting on the grassy cliff edge . snapping away , the bird seemed to take no interest in us as it looked around and did a little stretching . this magnificent bird returned to this ledge 3 times whilst we watched it , in the end we walked away because i ran out of space on my memory card . on the walk back , we saw a pair flying together , still giving superb views . a morning i 'll remember for a while , and an amazing experience . i took around 800 photos so there will be plenty more to follow ! equipment canon 7d , 400mm f5 . 6	bird

15659132627	positive	15659132627.jpg	jakar tsechu , young boy a tsechu ( or tshechu ) is an annual religious bhutanese festival held in each district or dzongkhag of bhutan on the tenth day of a month of the lunar tibetan calendar . tsechus are religious festivals , but also large social gatherings , which perform the function of social bonding among people of remote and spread out villages . large markets also congregate at the fair locations , leading to brisk commerce . the focal point of the tsechus are cham dances . these costumed , masked dances typically are moral vignettes , or based on incidents from the life of the 9th century teacher padmasambhava ( guru rinpoche ) and other saints . padmasambhava , the great scholar , visited tibet and bhutan in the 8th century and 9th century . he used to convert opponents of buddhism by performing rites , reciting mantras and finally performing a dance of subjugation to conquer local spirits and gods . he visited bhutan to aid the dying king sindhu raja . padmasambhava performed a series of such dances in the bumthang valley to restore the health of the king . the grateful king helped spread buddhism in bhutan . padmasambhava organized the first tsechu in bumthang , where the eight manifestations of padmasambhava were presented through eight forms of dances . these became the cham dances depicting the glory of padmasambhava . most tsechus also feature the unfurling of a thongdrel ( or thangka ) a large tapestry typically depicting a seated padmasambhava surrounded by holy beings , the mere viewing of which is said to cleanse the viewer of sin . the thongdrel is raised before dawn and rolled down by morning .

2877197638	positive	2877197638.jpg	greystones ( irish na clocha liatha ) is a coastal town in county wicklow , ireland . it is located on ireland s east coast , 8 km ( 5 miles ) south of bray and 27 km ( 17 mi ) south of dublin ( it is within the greater dublin area ) , with a population in the region of 15 , 000 . the town s name is derived from a one kilometre stretch of coastal grey rocks situated between two beaches this rocky area is known as the sea front . the harbour area and the railway station are at the northern and southern ends respectively . the north beach , which begins at the harbour , is a stony beach and some of its length is overlooked by the southern cliffs of bray head , which are subject to erosion . the south beach is a broad expansive sandy beach about one kilometre long . it was a blue flag beach and receives many visitors and tourists , mainly in the summer . the town is bordered by the irish sea to the east , bray head to the north and the wicklow mountains to the west . greystones is located south of the site of an ancient castle of the barony of rathdown . there was a hamlet which , like the castle , was known as rathdown , and which appeared on a 1712 map . this site occupied an area now known as the grove , about a quarter mile north of greystones harbour , but only the ruins of a chapel , st . crispin 's cell , survive . greystones is a much more recent settlement and is first mentioned in topographia hibernica , a 1795 publication . here it is described as a noted fishing place four miles beyond bray . in the early 1800s , there were some families scattered around the harbour , blacklion , windgates , killincarrig and rathdown . delgany was a more substantial and longer established village . however , greystones was put on the map with the coming of the railway in 1855 , a difficult undertaking which was performed in consultation with isambard kingdom brunel , the famous engineer . the train station was built on the line dividing the properties of two landowners the la touche family of bellevue house ( now in ruins , near delgany ) , and the hawkins whitshed family of killincarrig house ( which is now greystones golf club ) . it provided links with bray and dublin , and left room for development on the adjoining estates . in the latter half of the nineteenth century , under the ownership of william robert la touche , greystones' development gathered momentum . to the north of the station , church road , victoria road , and trafalgar road were laid out and many houses were built in the years following the arrival of the railway . following her father 's death , elizabeth hawkins whitshed was the sole inheritor of his property . in 1879 , she married frederick gustavus burnaby a soldier , politician and traveller . burnaby died in battle in 1885 and elizabeth remarried twice , but the property continued to be known as the burnaby estate . in the early 1900s , the burnabys began to expand the town on their side of the station , and the roads and houses of the burnaby were developed and the population grew considerably . the names of these two families remain well known today , with many roads and housing estates bearing their names . between 1885 and 1897 , the people of greystones campaigned for a harbour to aid the fishing industry and imports such as coal . the pier , dock , sea wall and boat slip remain but have endured substantial damage . in the early 1900s , the town felt the effects of coastal erosion ( which is still a major problem ) the loss of fields and most of the houses on the north beach road , and the costly inland relocation of the railway have all resulted . in 1968 , the old kish lighthouse foundation was added to the end of the pier . at the end of world war ii , cars and petrol became widely available , allowing greystones to gradually expand , filling in the space between itself and outlying areas such as blacklion , killincarrig , and delgany . however , the popularity of the railway declined its very existence being in jeopardy during the 1980s , as government cutbacks reduced the service to just a few trains per day . the 1990s brought a revival of sorts with the arrival of the electrified dart from bray , and a much more frequent schedule . greystones has experienced a huge increase in its population since the 1970s with the construction of several large housing estates . a new development at charlesland , just south of the town , includes over 1 , 000 dwelling units . as of the 2006 census the population of greystones , including town and environs , stands at 14 , 569 making it the second largest town in the county after bray . along with the housing developments , road networks and facilities have been improved to cater for the growth . the road between greystones and bray has been widened and realigned . a new dual carriageway link road ( r774 ) connecting greystones to the n11 has been completed . construction of a full interchange with the n11 is under way . according to the 2006 census , greystones has the largest church of ireland presence as a proportion of the population ( 9 . 77 ) .	castle

5006033525	positive	5006033525.jpg	super busy weekend and another late submission . my one goal for the group now is to get my pictures up before fridays lol . we 'll see how quickly i fail that . it 's been a while since i had a strictly bokeh focused photo . since my other ideas keep getting postponed due to various reasons ( lack of time and opportunity mostly ) , i set off to our favorite ( and closest ) bokeh spot a few days ago and snapped a whole series . this was the last picture i took and although others were better lighted , it begged to be the one . since i was working against the late afternoon sun , hike was a lot darker than the background . it took me i hours i to find a way to process this without totally blowing the white out . i think i finally found a happy medium . for once i do n't have much of a theme for the week , nor anything to talk about really . we spent the last two days at bff zoey 's , and today we were up at a dog event in carmel with the fellow 52 week groupie liz ( plus her pups , bishop and mercy ) second time we 've gotten together and the dogs stand each other rather well now . hopefully third time will be a charm and we can finally get some posed pictures of the trio ( the size difference from one to another is hilarious . ) weather 's been trying to cool down but having a hard time accomplishing that fully . evenings are usually nice though , so we 've started getting back into a more regular dog park groove and are picking up with our biking . also we 're able to take longer night walks again , which has always been most enjoyable to hike and me both . a lot of friends think i'm nuts to be wandering around the city outskirts at midnight as a female in my early 20s , but i never feel unsafe . i did it with my other dog when i was even younger and living in new york and i have no reason not to do it now . haiku , while i question his ability to actually do something if the need arose , has a quot do n't mess with me quot presence that many find intimidating . i laugh because he 's just the kind of dog i would run up to without a second thought , but i guess not everyone feels that way . and if you emerge from behind a dumpster or round a corner in the dark , he i will i lunge and bark his disapproval . although he 's barely 60lbs , it 's enough to deter most people . anyone who would go against that would likely not be stopped by even more excessive means , so i do n't see much point in editing my night walking habits . i'm not the type to live in fear of what could happen . life 's just too short , any way you look at it . i'm a shiny happy person with a shiny happy dog . you ca n't really argue with that .	dog

5493108562	positive	5493108562.jpg	the horse ( equus ferus caballus ) 2 3 is a hooved ( ungulate ) mammal , a subspecies of the family equidae . the horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi toed creature into the large , single toed animal of today . humans began to domesticate horses around 4000 bc , and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 bc . although most horses today are domesticated , there are still endangered populations of the przewalski 's horse , the only remaining true wild horse , as well as more common populations of feral horses which live in the wild but are descended from domesticated ancestors . there is an extensive , specialized vocabulary used to describe equine related concepts , covering everything from anatomy to life stages , size , colors , markings , breeds , locomotion , and behaviour . horses' anatomy enables them to make use of speed to escape predators and they have a well developed sense of balance and a strong fight or flight instinct . related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down . female horses , called mares , carry their young for approximately 11 months , and a young horse , called a foal , can stand and run shortly following birth . most domesticated horses begin training under saddle or in harness between the ages of two and four . they reach full adult development by age five , and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years . horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament spirited quot hot bloods quot with speed and endurance quot cold bloods quot , such as draft horses and some ponies , suitable for slow , heavy work and quot warmbloods quot , developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods , often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes , particularly in europe . there are over 300 breeds of horses in the world today , developed for many different uses . horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non competitive recreational pursuits , as well as in working activities such as police work , agriculture , entertainment , and therapy . horses were historically used in warfare , from which a wide variety of riding and driving techniques developed , using many different styles of equipment and methods of control . many products are derived from horses , including meat , milk , hide , hair , bone , and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares . humans provide domesticated horses with food , water and shelter , as well as attention from specialists such as veterinarians and farriers .	horse

6163280595	positive	6163280595.jpg	history of peckerwood garden john g . fairey thirty years ago i came to texas to teach first year design in the school of architecture at texas a amp m university and in 1971 purchased the land that forms the nucleus of my garden . the site with its clear , spring fed brook reminded me of quot magical places quot in south carolina where i grew up and what began innocently , as a pursuit of a sense of place , fast evolved into a passion . this enthusiasm continues unchecked , and the garden is still evolving on a site that has grown to almost 40 acres and abounds with new projects and purpose . there are many ways to describe peckerwood garden it is a collection of more than 3 , 000 plants including many rarities it is a conservation garden containing examples of numerous threatened species , many of which are no longer found in the wild it is a laboratory garden testing a wide range of quot new quot plants and our mexican discoveries . it is a garden with a mission to encourage other gardeners to see a beauty in landscape that is consistent with our plants and climate it is a pioneering garden exploring new plants and cultivation methods and aesthetic concepts for other gardeners . it is a garden that looks to the future , not to the past . yet , most essential , it is my studio , a place where artistic and horticultural research are fused to create an environment that stimulates all of the senses , including the most elusive of all , our sense of time . my background and education as a painter have trained me to see the garden as an ever changing interaction of texture , color , rhythm , and space it is a series of rooms constructed with a wide variety of plant material in which trees , shrubs , light , shade , paths , steps , and water create and balance the composition . . . spaces created are arranged so that when walking , one catches glimpses of other spaces there is not a beginning or ending but a progressive journey of discovery . peckerwood historical photoa tornado destroyed the high canopy of giant , old trees in 1983 . in hindsight , the devastation provided the opportunity to explore new directions in the garden that better reflected my ideas about space and to investigate and experiment with new plant material . at this time i was joined in this enterprise by carl schoenfeld , and we started researching native plants and their mexican and asian counterparts in the garden . the constant pursuit of new plants for the garden design has kept us aware of the need to evolve the garden continuously . with each addition and change , new problems arise to be solved , resulting in the evolution of the garden both visually and conceptually . renowned plantsman and native plant explorer , lynn lowrey ( whose death was a keenly felt loss ) introduced me to my first texas native plant and for 25 years lent me his support and knowledge . it was lynn who in 1988 invited us to join him on a botanizing trip in the mountains of northern mexico . now veterans of about 100 expeditions to diverse remote regions of mexico , we are striving to document and conserve a rapidly vanishing uncatalogued matrix of beautiful and uniquely diversified mexican plants . our goal is to provide a cultural bridge between mexico and the united states and , we hope , raise awareness on both sides of the border about the richness of this horticultural trove and the threat of its irrevocable loss due to overgrazing and other growing economic pressures . we feel strongly about conservation work . in order for these extraordinary plants to be fully appreciated , they must be brought to the attention of the public . plant tag graveyardthe best way to achieve this is to share plant material and information with other public institutions . germplasm collected from these mexican expeditions as well as the results of plant testing in the garden were shared with arboreta and interested plant societies . in the early 1990 's , doctor j . c . raulston , director , north carolina state arboretum ( now j . c . raulston arboretum ) distributed in one year alone over 9 , 000 plants grown from seed that we shared with him . the best of these plants are beginning to make their way into the nursery trade and individual gardens . the urgency value of the mexican plant exploration has been a major factor in motivating me to donate my garden to the people of texas . it is the beginning of a new level of sharing , both the garden and its new plants , with an ever wider constituency . energy can now be directed to plant research in collaboration with an expanded group of participating institutions . in this way , i hope , the garden and the program to seek out and test new plants will continue into the next century . in this world of overemphasized technology in which values are often based on the superficial , gardens are a must for the public . they reacquaint us with the natural world , with our individual and shared past they bring healing , literally and figuratively , to many of our ills .	plant

( the color comes to this high country area of zion while things are still mostly green back down in zion canyon . ) at this point em some em cottonwood and box elder trees were changing , though there was a lot of green still around . however , the red maples , which seem to change first , were at peak color conditions in many spots . as we drove along the park road , we were more or less hanging out the windows , looking for those combinations of light ( quality and angle ) , color ( or trees and rocks ) , and geology that might make good photographs . most often we found ourselves looking down into narrow canyons where colorful trees lined the banks of the stream beds . sometimes we photographed from above , but the most productive shooting involved hiking down into these canyons and then slowly walking them while looking intently for subjects . of course , the red maples do n't require a lot of careful looking ! this group of trees was in a shady curve in the bottom of a canyon , so i found a frame filling bunch of branches and leaves and made a few exposures . a href http www . gdanmitchell . com 2007 08 26 thoughts on my summer 2007 backpacking photography kit dan at shuksan 60squarecrop rel nofollow a a href http www . gdanmitchell . com rel nofollow em strong g dan mitchell strong em a is a california photographer whose subjects include the pacific coast , redwood forests , central california oak grasslands , the sierra nevada , california deserts , urban landscapes , night photography , and more . a href http www . gdanmitchell . com rel nofollow blog a a href http www . gdanmitchell . com about rel nofollow about a a href http www . flickr . com photos gdanmitchell flickr a a href http twitter . com gdanmitchell rel nofollow twitter a a href http www . facebook . com gdanmitchellphotography rel nofollow facebook a a href https plus . google . com u 0 102554407414282880001 rel nofollow google a a href http 500px . com gdanmitchell rel nofollow 500px . com a a href http www . linkedin . com in gdanmitchell rel nofollow linkedin a a href mailto dan gdanmitchell . com rel nofollow email a em text , photographs , and other media are copyright g dan mitchell ( or others when indicated ) and strong are not strong in the public domain and may strong not strong be used on websites , blogs , or in other media without advance permission from a href http www . gdanmitchell . com rel nofollow g dan mitchell a . em	tree
