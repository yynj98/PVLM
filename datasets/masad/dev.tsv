7987547531	negative	7987547531.jpg	it s kind of strange . i had been in this room once before , and sat maybe three feet away from this very bird i photographed , yet had no idea he ( or she , but for all intensive purposes we ll go with he ) was even there . then , on a return trip two months later , i found myself in the room once again and noticed this little guy . over the course of editing this photo , i ve learned more and more about him and it really kind of took me by surprise . through bringing out the detail of the photograph , i brought out the detail of the last 72 ( give or take ) hours of his life . now i m no scientist or mortician , but the educated guesses i have come up with are he broke his back . most likely from flying around in the pitch black that this building becomes at night . my guess is he got trapped during the day , and was still frantically attempting to escape by the time night fell . he was not trapped long . the area that his remaining , mummified abdominal encasing engulfs is too plump to reflect starvation . he felt it . he was likely mid flight ( as mentioned before ) . parts of his upper wing are broken and his eyes are closed . unless he was in the middle of blinking , it s safe to assume a bird isn t going to be flying with his eyes closed . even in the pitch black . so he probably closed his eyes immediately at impact , once he felt what was happening . also , not pictured , his toes were curled . he braced for impact . what i ve learned from the photo aside , i especially loved how mr . bird here took me by surprise but i chose to bring him out in the photograph instead , so people can appreciate his presence instead of scrolling past and dismissing him as just another pile of asbestos ( like i initially did ) . i also loved how he really looks like he just fell asleep . that s what i thought originally , and that s how it really looks . like he curled up all by himself and rested his little head down and just fell asleep . those two aspects are what made me come up with the titles i chose . he fell asleep and has now become almost camouflaged , almost to never again make a peep . but i changed that a little bit , so this image will forever remain as his legacy is carted away with the rest of our beloved harlem . i guess you could say that s part of the reason i love photographing these buildings as much as i do . they ve gone to sleep and each stage they enter is like a stage of life and with each stage of life and death ( literal and figurative ) , every thing speaks . and as every stage passes , there s another message they keep the same messages i try to capture with my photography .	bird

5602244453	negative	5602244453.jpg	i finally made it out to downtown ishinomaki with a friend on april 3rd , 2011 . although we made it out quite late , we were able to help a little by distributing water and food to a few people . although downtown ishinomaki was hit very hard by the tsunami , it was very uplifting to see the progress that had already been made . military supply camps , squads of police , and groups of volunteers were all working tirelessly in restoration . the downtown area seemed to be getting far more attention than any of the other areas i 've visited , but rightfully so , since it has a far higher population density . despite the incredible progress that had been made , there is clearly still a lot to do . the chorus of destroyed boats , cars , and houses again echoed throughout the town . oil logged muck permeated through the hills of debris and toxic smells wafted through the air , but people managed to keep their spirits up regardless . hide quoted text the most somber part of the day for me , was after we left the downtown area and made our way up to hiyoriyama park . i would sometimes come up to hiyoriyama to view the cherry blossoms , watch the sunrise , or relax after archery . every time i went up to the park , i was stunned by the natural beauty and panoramic view of this sprawling city creeping to edge of the ocean . this time , however , i felt as though i was punched in the gut with the starkest realization of utter destruction that i had experienced until this point . the once beautiful view of a thriving city reaching out into the ocean , was replaced with the surreal image of toppled homes and bare foundations . a handful of cars weaving through nearly impassable roads created the only movement in what could easily be confused with a garbage dump or wasteland . i know that eventually the area will be restored , but it will take a lot of work and time to heal the wounds . if you would like to donate to red cross japan , please visit their website here a href http www . jrc . or . jp english relief l4 vcms4 00002070 . html rel nofollow www . jrc . or . jp english relief l4 vcms4 00002070 . html a also , i have decided to donate all of the profits from any of the pictures sold on my website until at least march 11 , 2012 . a href http carstenknoche . com march 25 2011 japan earthquake disaster rel nofollow carstenknoche . com march 25 2011 japan earthquake disaster a lastly , you can read more stories and see more pictures from a variety of different people by purchasing quakebook . all revenue from the book will also be donated to red cross japan . here is their website a href http www . quakebook . org rel nofollow www . quakebook . org a thank you for facing this tragedy with us . carsten knoche	car

8651978580	negative	8651978580.jpg	located 4 files west of fostoria in southern dickinson county , iowa , this bridge spans the little sioux river , carrying an abandoned road ( 180th avenue ) . at 83 feet , the 1909 span is the only thacher pony truss that was ever built . the bridge was originally built at the site of the us 71 bridge in okoboji , spanning the strait connecting east and west lake okobojis connecting okoboji and arnolds park . however the bridge was replaced by a concrete arch bridge in 1926 and this truss bridge was relocated here . its future is in doubt , for as you can see in my video commentary , the bridge was knocked off its foundation by flooding in 2011 . upon consultation with authorities , there seems to be no plan as to what to do with the bridge , as it sits in the river , covered with tree branches . the truss bridge appears to be in good shape and can be used again , but its future is undoubtedly questionable even to this day . . . .	road

15826777506	positive	15826777506.jpg	i have grown up thinking so strongly that september was my favourite month of the year that i never actually questioned it until this year s beautiful autumn rolled around . i am a september child , and i love its times when it gets cold enough to sense the spirit of the coming season , i love sunflowers and the first signs of a time when i don t seem to mind so much about hard days . but september tends to get busy and unsettling , and when october arrives , everything finally seems to fall into place . i always take more time to think back to what was , and in the best case end up appreciating where i am now . october feels like first uni days , window views covered with bright and earthly colours , long runs in the forest , tea with freshly squeezed orange juice , photo taking happiness , forming new habits while letting go of old thoughts , inner warmth and time spent alone . october , for some reason , is just my happy place .	autumn

4554452754	positive	4554452754.jpg	i took delight last week in watching 10 mute swans on the shores of lake ontario . they were displaying mating rituals and enjoying the shallow waters and sunshine . . i found myself lost in time . . . . . this young cygnet seemed full of energy and enjoyed being chased ! ! always fun to watch . this one appears to be walking on water ) quot downy young mute swans ( called cygnets ) come in two color morphs a gray form and a white form . the gray ( or quot royal quot ) chicks start off with gray down and grow in gray brown and white feathers , giving them a mottled look . white ( or quot polish quot ) chicks have all white down and juvenal feathers . adults of the white morph may have pink or gray legs and feet instead of black , but otherwise the adults look alike . quot thank you all for your visits and birthday greetings . i had a wonderful birthday sharing it with my nephew who was also born on the 24th ) of april . unfortunately , a dear family friend passed away and i'm going to be away to attend the funeral . best viewed large .	bird

4768450402	positive	4768450402.jpg	thanks very much to my nextdoor neighbours margaret and harold who let me know there was a sparrowhawk in their garden . she was a bit upset about it but it 's no different to a blue tit eating a caterpillar , just a bit more graphic ! it was so unafraid that we stood only about 4 or 5 metres away while chatting ! they thought it was a pigeon but i think it 's a collared dove ? photgraphing a sparrowhawk with prey has been pretty much top of my list of things i 'd love to shoot . i totally object to people demonising birds with sharp beaks but looking at the pictures i could n't help but think of the collared dove which during the winter was my constant companion while photographing the other birds in the garden . i 'd seen three failed attacks on doves before so knew there would be a success sooner or later . seen up close sparrowhawks are awesome birds , this one seemed pretty small , i'm not sure if it 's a juvenile ? looking at the other pictures it definitely is a collared dove . ps the dove was still alive here and was for several minutes afterwards , not pleasant . . . . .	bird

958195406	positive	958195406.jpg	this bird , unsurprisingly , is a member of a mariachi band . the maraca is the instrument of choice for this bird , as he lacks the mobility to play a trumpet or guitar . the band is not a particularly successful one as they only play military funerals and booze fueled parties for high school students . he lives in a small one bedroom apartment that he shares with a horse . despite the lack of success of the band , the two of them are able to pay their rent as they have a reality television show modeled after the odd couple , in which the two of them struggle to live with each other . the horse will bring home a female horse , but the bird is practicing his maracas . the horse will ask him to leave , but the bird needs to practice for his gig the next day . needless to say , hilarity ensues . in his free time , this awesome bird spends his time on the local lake in a canoe , rowing only on the left side , thus going in circles for hours , going nowhere . in one instance , he was stranded on the lake for weeks , and almost starved to death . he was rescued by a hot air balloon , piloted by , you guessed it , a hot dog that picked up his unconscious body and dropped it off at a local hospital . he broke several bones in the process , but survived . a href http www . devastationstudios . com blog rel nofollow www . devastationstudios . com blog a	bird

2876495959	positive	2876495959.jpg	greystones ( irish na clocha liatha ) is a coastal town in county wicklow , ireland . it is located on ireland s east coast , 8 km ( 5 miles ) south of bray and 27 km ( 17 mi ) south of dublin ( it is within the greater dublin area ) , with a population in the region of 15 , 000 . the town s name is derived from a one kilometre stretch of coastal grey rocks situated between two beaches this rocky area is known as the sea front . the harbour area and the railway station are at the northern and southern ends respectively . the north beach , which begins at the harbour , is a stony beach and some of its length is overlooked by the southern cliffs of bray head , which are subject to erosion . the south beach is a broad expansive sandy beach about one kilometre long . it was a blue flag beach and receives many visitors and tourists , mainly in the summer . the town is bordered by the irish sea to the east , bray head to the north and the wicklow mountains to the west . greystones is located south of the site of an ancient castle of the barony of rathdown . there was a hamlet which , like the castle , was known as rathdown , and which appeared on a 1712 map . this site occupied an area now known as the grove , about a quarter mile north of greystones harbour , but only the ruins of a chapel , st . crispin 's cell , survive . greystones is a much more recent settlement and is first mentioned in topographia hibernica , a 1795 publication . here it is described as a noted fishing place four miles beyond bray . in the early 1800s , there were some families scattered around the harbour , blacklion , windgates , killincarrig and rathdown . delgany was a more substantial and longer established village . however , greystones was put on the map with the coming of the railway in 1855 , a difficult undertaking which was performed in consultation with isambard kingdom brunel , the famous engineer . the train station was built on the line dividing the properties of two landowners the la touche family of bellevue house ( now in ruins , near delgany ) , and the hawkins whitshed family of killincarrig house ( which is now greystones golf club ) . it provided links with bray and dublin , and left room for development on the adjoining estates . in the latter half of the nineteenth century , under the ownership of william robert la touche , greystones' development gathered momentum . to the north of the station , church road , victoria road , and trafalgar road were laid out and many houses were built in the years following the arrival of the railway . following her father 's death , elizabeth hawkins whitshed was the sole inheritor of his property . in 1879 , she married frederick gustavus burnaby a soldier , politician and traveller . burnaby died in battle in 1885 and elizabeth remarried twice , but the property continued to be known as the burnaby estate . in the early 1900s , the burnabys began to expand the town on their side of the station , and the roads and houses of the burnaby were developed and the population grew considerably . the names of these two families remain well known today , with many roads and housing estates bearing their names . between 1885 and 1897 , the people of greystones campaigned for a harbour to aid the fishing industry and imports such as coal . the pier , dock , sea wall and boat slip remain but have endured substantial damage . in the early 1900s , the town felt the effects of coastal erosion ( which is still a major problem ) the loss of fields and most of the houses on the north beach road , and the costly inland relocation of the railway have all resulted . in 1968 , the old kish lighthouse foundation was added to the end of the pier . at the end of world war ii , cars and petrol became widely available , allowing greystones to gradually expand , filling in the space between itself and outlying areas such as blacklion , killincarrig , and delgany . however , the popularity of the railway declined its very existence being in jeopardy during the 1980s , as government cutbacks reduced the service to just a few trains per day . the 1990s brought a revival of sorts with the arrival of the electrified dart from bray , and a much more frequent schedule . greystones has experienced a huge increase in its population since the 1970s with the construction of several large housing estates . a new development at charlesland , just south of the town , includes over 1 , 000 dwelling units . as of the 2006 census the population of greystones , including town and environs , stands at 14 , 569 making it the second largest town in the county after bray . along with the housing developments , road networks and facilities have been improved to cater for the growth . the road between greystones and bray has been widened and realigned . a new dual carriageway link road ( r774 ) connecting greystones to the n11 has been completed . construction of a full interchange with the n11 is under way . according to the 2006 census , greystones has the largest church of ireland presence as a proportion of the population ( 9 . 77 ) .	castle

273105868	positive	273105868.jpg	the b sierra nevada b is a mountain range that is almost entirely in the eastern portion of the u . s . state of california . the range is also known as the sierra . b geography b the sierra nevada stretches 400 miles ( 650 km ) , from fredonyer pass in the north to tehachapi pass in the south . it is bounded on the west by california 's central valley , and on the east by the great basin . in west east cross section , the sierra is shaped like a non equilateral triangle the altitude gradually increases as you travel east , until you reach the crest , whereupon the altitude rapidly decreases , forming a steep escarpment . thus , the crest runs principally along the eastern edge of the sierra nevada range . rivers flowing west from the sierra crest eventually drain into the pacific ocean , while rivers draining east flow into the great basin and do not reach any ocean . however , water from several streams and the owens river is redirected to the city of los angeles ( see los angeles aqueduct ) . thus , some east flowing river water does make it to the pacific ocean . there are several notable geographical features in the sierra nevada lake tahoe is a large , clear freshwater lake in the northern sierra nevada , with an elevation of 6 , 225 feet ( 1 , 897 m ) and an area of 191 square miles ( 489 km ) . lake tahoe lies between the main sierra and the carson range , a spur of the sierra . hetch hetchy valley , yosemite valley , kings canyon , tehipite valley and kern canyon are the most well known of many beautiful , glacially scoured canyons on the west side of the sierra . yosemite national park is filled with stunning features , such as waterfalls and granite domes . mount whitney , at 14 , 505 feet ( 4 , 421 m ) , is the highest point in the contiguous united states . groves of giant sequoias sequoiadendron giganteum occur along a narrow band of altitude on the western side of the sierra nevada . giant sequoias are the most massive trees in the world . the height of the mountains in the sierra nevada gradually increases from north to south . between fredonyer pass and lake tahoe , the peaks range from 5 , 000 ft . ( 1 , 524 m ) to 8 , 000 ft . ( 2 , 438 m ) . the crest near lake tahoe is roughly 9 , 000 ft ( 2 , 700 m ) high , with several peaks as high as mount rose ( 10 , 778 ft . or 3 , 285 m ) , the crest near yosemite national park is roughly 13 , 000 ft ( 4 , 000 m ) high at mount dana and mount lyell , and the entire range attains its peak at mount whitney . south of mount whitney , the range diminishes in elevation , but there are still several highpoints like florence peak ( 12 , 405 ft . or 3 , 781 m ) and olancha peak ( 12 , 123 ft . or 3 , 695 m ) . the range still climbs almost to 10 , 000 ft . ( 3 , 048 m ) near isabella lake , but south of the lake , the peaks reach only to a modest 8 , 000 ft . ( 2 , 438 m ) . b geology b the geological history of the sierra nevada begins in the jurassic period , approximately 150 million years ago . at that time , an island arc collided with the west coast of north america and raised a set of mountains , in an event called the nevadan orogeny . this event produced metamorphic rock . at roughly the same time , a subduction zone started to form at the edge of the continent . this means that an oceanic plate started to dive beneath the north american plate . magma from the melting oceanic plate rose and created plutons of solid granite , deep below the surface . these plutons formed at various times , from 115 million to 87 million years ago . by 65 million years ago , the proto sierra nevada was worn down to a range of rolling low mountains , a few thousand feet high . about 25 million years ago , the sierra nevada started to rise and tilt to the west . rivers started cutting deep canyons on both sides of the range . the earth 's climate cooled , and ice ages started about 2 . 5 million years ago . glaciers carved out characteristic u shaped canyons throughout the sierra . the combination of river and glacier erosion exposed the granitic plutons previously buried , leaving only a remnant of metamorphic rock on top of some sierra peaks . the rocks of the ancient plutons are known as the sierra nevada batholith . uplift of the sierra nevada continues today , especially along its eastern side . this uplift causes large earthquakes , such as the lone pine earthquake of 1872 .	cloud

4646488001	positive	4646488001.jpg	well , these were from my quot in case i do n't get anything better this week quot series , taken on monday . i generally do n't use pictures from the first day of the week because i'm afraid of missing out on other opportunities . i shot some nice photos around my building yesterday , and i'm sure i 'll take plenty more this weekend , but i could n't get these out of my head . so i figured i 'd go with my gut . not that they 're anything amazing . certainly nothing special . i just really like them . i see lots of people photographing flowers as of late . makes sense since it 's spring and all . but there 's a curious lack of interesting flowers downtown . just weeds . and lots of clovers . this is another of our little quot secret spots quot at a nearby public park where i can sneak haiku off leash for a romp . i found it back when i had my previous dog , and we used to spend a lot of time there . it was one of the first spots i took hike as a puppy , to work on his being trustworthy while loose ( which for many huskies and husky mixes is no small task . ) it 's also along the southbound tracks ( they seem to lead to all the nice places ! ) you can see them in the background here , i thought it made for an interesting quot divide . quot the positioning of this is a lot like a shot i have from a few weeks back in this set , taken at the same park but a different location . i do n't really like to have such similar photos , especially so close together , but i 'll bite the bullet . i kept flip flopping between pictures and it somehow always came back to this . it wanted to be used . hike did n't have to do anything demanding for once . other than endure the heat . it 's been over 80 the last few days , with added humidity . . . and it 's not even summer yet ? ! so that 's that . enjoy your holiday weekend , for those who have it ! a href http bighugelabs . com onblack . php ? id 4646488001 amp bg white rel nofollow view on white a	dog

6163807920	positive	6163807920.jpg	history of peckerwood garden john g . fairey thirty years ago i came to texas to teach first year design in the school of architecture at texas a amp m university and in 1971 purchased the land that forms the nucleus of my garden . the site with its clear , spring fed brook reminded me of quot magical places quot in south carolina where i grew up and what began innocently , as a pursuit of a sense of place , fast evolved into a passion . this enthusiasm continues unchecked , and the garden is still evolving on a site that has grown to almost 40 acres and abounds with new projects and purpose . there are many ways to describe peckerwood garden it is a collection of more than 3 , 000 plants including many rarities it is a conservation garden containing examples of numerous threatened species , many of which are no longer found in the wild it is a laboratory garden testing a wide range of quot new quot plants and our mexican discoveries . it is a garden with a mission to encourage other gardeners to see a beauty in landscape that is consistent with our plants and climate it is a pioneering garden exploring new plants and cultivation methods and aesthetic concepts for other gardeners . it is a garden that looks to the future , not to the past . yet , most essential , it is my studio , a place where artistic and horticultural research are fused to create an environment that stimulates all of the senses , including the most elusive of all , our sense of time . my background and education as a painter have trained me to see the garden as an ever changing interaction of texture , color , rhythm , and space it is a series of rooms constructed with a wide variety of plant material in which trees , shrubs , light , shade , paths , steps , and water create and balance the composition . . . spaces created are arranged so that when walking , one catches glimpses of other spaces there is not a beginning or ending but a progressive journey of discovery . peckerwood historical photoa tornado destroyed the high canopy of giant , old trees in 1983 . in hindsight , the devastation provided the opportunity to explore new directions in the garden that better reflected my ideas about space and to investigate and experiment with new plant material . at this time i was joined in this enterprise by carl schoenfeld , and we started researching native plants and their mexican and asian counterparts in the garden . the constant pursuit of new plants for the garden design has kept us aware of the need to evolve the garden continuously . with each addition and change , new problems arise to be solved , resulting in the evolution of the garden both visually and conceptually . renowned plantsman and native plant explorer , lynn lowrey ( whose death was a keenly felt loss ) introduced me to my first texas native plant and for 25 years lent me his support and knowledge . it was lynn who in 1988 invited us to join him on a botanizing trip in the mountains of northern mexico . now veterans of about 100 expeditions to diverse remote regions of mexico , we are striving to document and conserve a rapidly vanishing uncatalogued matrix of beautiful and uniquely diversified mexican plants . our goal is to provide a cultural bridge between mexico and the united states and , we hope , raise awareness on both sides of the border about the richness of this horticultural trove and the threat of its irrevocable loss due to overgrazing and other growing economic pressures . we feel strongly about conservation work . in order for these extraordinary plants to be fully appreciated , they must be brought to the attention of the public . plant tag graveyardthe best way to achieve this is to share plant material and information with other public institutions . germplasm collected from these mexican expeditions as well as the results of plant testing in the garden were shared with arboreta and interested plant societies . in the early 1990 's , doctor j . c . raulston , director , north carolina state arboretum ( now j . c . raulston arboretum ) distributed in one year alone over 9 , 000 plants grown from seed that we shared with him . the best of these plants are beginning to make their way into the nursery trade and individual gardens . the urgency value of the mexican plant exploration has been a major factor in motivating me to donate my garden to the people of texas . it is the beginning of a new level of sharing , both the garden and its new plants , with an ever wider constituency . energy can now be directed to plant research in collaboration with an expanded group of participating institutions . in this way , i hope , the garden and the program to seek out and test new plants will continue into the next century . in this world of overemphasized technology in which values are often based on the superficial , gardens are a must for the public . they reacquaint us with the natural world , with our individual and shared past they bring healing , literally and figuratively , to many of our ills .	plant
