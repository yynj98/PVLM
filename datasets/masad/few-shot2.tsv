3523858820	negative	3523858820.jpg	tradicionalment , a catalunya la diada de sant jordi s el dia dels enamorats , i s costum que les parelles es regalin una rosa i un llibre . la pres ncia del llibre s deguda a que la diada coincideix amb el dia internacional del llibre , que des de 1930 commemora la mort de miguel de cervantes . la diada t un caire reivindicatiu de la cultura catalana i molts balcons s'engalanen amb la senyera . a tot barcelona es venen llibres i roses , per s a la rambla on l'esdeveniment arriba a la seva m xima expressi . a les parades habituals de la rambla se n'afegeixen de temporals . s tradicional promoure la venda de llibres amb signatures dels autors i fent un descompte al preu de venda . les llibreries properes a pla a catalunya estan plenes de gom a gom i obren fins i tot si es diumenge . quant a les roses es transformen en un negoci del que tothom se n'aprofita . hi ha parades amb reivindicacions pol tiques , per ajudar a organitzacions humanit ries , per recaptar fons per escoles o simplement per a aconseguir alguns diners extra . els mitjans de comunicaci fan retransmissions en directe des dels punts m s emblem tics . per sobre tot cal destacar l'ambient festiu que genera la diada . es realitzen activitats a les biblioteques i concerts als carrers que s'afegeixen a l'atrafegada agenda cultural de la ciutat comtal . barcelona is also the capital of the spanish province of catalonia . st george is the patron saint of catalonia . come to barcelona on the 23rd of april and join in the transformation of barcelona into a town of celebration . although this is not a national holiday , the crowded streets and the bustle of rose and book buying and carrying give a happy party atmosphere . of course , clement warm weather helps too . everywhere there are stalls selling single , dragon s blood red , roses , decorated with the red and yellow catalan colours , or the stalls sell books , or both . the streets , metro stations , even the roof top of a gaudi house open to the public have a stall , or sometimes a couple of students , selling roses or books . the bookstalls alone number over three hundred . about 2 , 000 , 000 books are sold on the day of sant jordi and some 3 , 500 , 000 roses . japan now imitates this catalan day of the book and the rose . on the front of the buses flutter flags , of red and yellow stripes for catalonia and white with a red cross for st george , or his catalan name , sant jordi ( san jorge is in spanish ) . but why this sudden fever for books and roses ? in catalonia , whose capital is barcelona , on st george s day , gifts are exchanged between sweethearts a rose to the woman , a book to the man . this day is also called the day of lovers . the roses are given in memory of st jordi , who rescued a princess from the dragon he slew . the blood spilt from the dragon grew into a rose that jordi gave to the rescued princess , a symbol of love and friendship , or at least so they tell me . books started being given on st jordi s day from 1923 when a barcelona bookseller started the custom to help sell books , using as a hook the death date of two famous great writers on 23rd april 1616 spain s miguel cervantes , author of don quixote , and england s william shakespeare . 23rd april has also been designated international book day by unesco . it is estimated that 6 million roses and 400 , 000 books ( half catalonia s yearly book sales ) are sold in barcelona on st george s day . note that devoted sons may buy their mother a pot of orchids or other flowers instead . tradicionalmente en catalu a la diada de sant jordi como es conocido este d a all , es el d a de los enamorados , en el cual las personas intercambian y regalan rosas y libros a su pareja y personas queridas . se cree que la tradici n de regalar en esta fecha una rosa a la mujer amada se remonta probablemente hasta el siglo xv . algunas versiones hacen coincidir esta pr ctica con la feria de las rosas o de los enamorados que ten a lugar en barcelona durante el verano . es un hecho constatado que en aquella poca ya se repart an rosas a las mujeres que asist an a la misa oficiada en la capilla de san jorge del palacio de la generalidad de catalu a en esta fecha . la rosa va acompa ada de una senyera y una espiga de trigo . el color rojo de la rosa simboliza la pasi n , la senyera al patr n de catalu a y la espiga de trigo representa la fertilidad . el d a de sant jordi tiene un aspecto reinvindicativo de la cultura catalana y muchos balcones lucen la bandera aut noma , la senyera . en toda catalu a se venden cromos y llaveros llegando a su m xima expresi n en las ramblas , donde a los puestos habituales se a aden temporales . es tradicional promover la venta de libros con firmas de los autores y un descuento al precio de venta . normalmente tambi n se realizan actividades en las bibliotecas y conciertos en las calles que se a aden a la agenda cultural de la ciudad condal .	street
