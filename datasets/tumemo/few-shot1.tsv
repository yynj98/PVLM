641	Angry	641.jpg	I’m so frustrated right now that I’m not going to do anything but leave this right here with a few disclaimers and a side note. DISCLAIMER: the guy’s name and profile picture have been marked out for privacy purposes and because this isn’t about the person commenting, but about the culture and way of thinking he represents as a whole. DISCLAIMER: if any of my comments seem misandrist in any way, i apologize for that wasn’t my intention. I do not hate all men, nor do I believe that men are inherently evil and idiotic, however the culture and way of thinking he is representing (as described as “shitty misogynistic fragile male ego?. That being said, I reiterate that I do not hate men and apologize if this comes across as misandrist. I have an older and a younger brother who I love very much and while they make women jokes, they’re open to men jokes and they treat, in my older brother’s case, his wife, and in my younger brother’s case, the girls he dates, with the utmost respect and they treat them the way they would like to be treated and while they align themselves with the traditional/biblical marriage (women are to be submissive and men are to lead), they still treat their significant others with respect and equality, and so seeing shit like this makes me angry because this is mistakenly tagged with men everywhere, including my brothers who are not like that. While it’s possible that my brothers agree with this list, if I were to ask them the first question I asked this guy, they would say “not at all, I would treat her the same?

Kasi hindi naman talaga ako importante. Sinabi lang na mahal ako pero sa totoo may galit din sila sa akin deep inside. Mahirap lang talaga magtrust sa mga tao ngayon. Never talk to a stranger.

52539	Calm	52539.jpg	A SETUP ON THE BEACH! This picture was captured in Kochi Kerala in India. Kochi, also known as Cochin, is a major port city. I was here exploring this beautiful beach when suddenly my eyes were attracted towards these fishing nets and the way they were used. The setup intrigued me and that’s when I knew that I found my new subject that I wanted to captured. I started to explore around this setup to find the perfect and the most intriguing frame. And when I found it, I captured this perfect frame. Later when I saw this picture I felt that it was a picture about an incompleted hut with an entrance in the middle of a beach! (at Kochi, India)

58561	Calm	58561.jpg	Happy Tuesday!!! Today I needed a good quote and calming your mind and not worrying so much. Lately I’ve been waking up in the morning and immediately wonder how my stomach and intestines are going to feel today. And how much energy I’m going to have. Also, I’ve been quite tense, thinking how fast each day goes. Everything just runs together. It seems I do have a lot on my mind. I try so hard to block all these worried thoughts but it’s hard in the moment. Before I got sick I never had to worry about hardly anything. Now I am in constant pain and anxiety and stress that makes my pain worse. I need to keep practicing shutting out all the worrying and stress around me and just focus on what makes me feel better. Living with mental and physical illnesses is hard but I have faith that I will feel better eventually. That’s all you can do sometimes, have faith that you will feel better one day. I pray you all have a blessed and relaxing day!!! 😊😄💪🏻🙏🏻💖

63247	Calm	63247.jpg	Every bit of serene tranquility JMT DAY 14 - SUNSET AT MTR Sunset at MTR The switchbacks that we were walking down to reach Muir Trail Ranch, aka MTR, offered a pretty cool view of the valley that the ranch was tucked in. I also thought that particular section of the trail would have been quite challenging to climb in the sun as the trail offered almost no shade. The ranch turned out to be quite small. There was no cafe or modern toilets, like the ones that a thru hiker would appreciate at Vermilion Valley Resort. We learned that mail, such as our resupply buckets, was picked up at Florence Lake and brought in by either mules, horses or trucks. Once settled in at the campground established by South Fork San Joaquin River, we explored the area a little. We were told that there were hot springs across the river. My buddy Henry and I decided to check it out early next day. As the sun was setting, I grabbed my gear and headed down to the river, which was quite shallow. I set up my camera and waited for the sunset glow to be cast upon the ridge in the distance. Soon the bright orange glow slowly fell on the ridge while the tall pines along the river stood tall. I could taste every bit of serene tranquility permeating through the forest. Muir Trail Rach, Sierra National Forest, CA (at Sierra National Forest)

I used to feel that way, until I realised it’s an ego trap. The idea of instagram is to share pictures, if you decide to like it it’s lovely to let someone know their picture touched you. If they don’t like your pictures or follow you back there are 2 clear reasons, first one instagram is limited so you can only see 100 notifications from what I have seen. When you have so many pictures and likes the feed goes mental so not sure how I had 200 followers then went back to 125. I have not seen these people come and go other than by the numbers 🤔 I am not after likes/followers. I want to share my pictures, and web, if I find yours that will be destiny’s mysterious ways 🕉🙏🏻. 2nd one coz they have no idea what your profile is about or they don’t have time/battery/wifi! Ps my feed has gone mental so getting notifications with a lot of delay 🙀

67802	Fear	67802.jpg	What’s really going on in PTSD brains? Experts suggest new theory For decades, neuroscientists and physicians have tried to get to the bottom of the age-old mystery of post-traumatic stress disorder, to explain why only some people are vulnerable and why they experience so many symptoms and so much disability. All experts in the field now agree that PTSD indeed has its roots in very real, physical processes within the brain ?and not in some sort of psychological “weakness? But no clear consensus has emerged about what exactly has gone “wrong?in the brain. In a Perspective article published in Neuron, a pair of University of Michigan Medical School professors ?who have studied PTSD from many angles for many years ?put forth a theory of PTSD that draws from and integrates decades of prior research. They hope to stimulate interest in the theory and invite others in the field to test it. The bottom line, they say, is that people with PTSD appear to suffer from disrupted context processing. That’s a core brain function that allows people and animals to recognize that a particular stimulus may require different responses depending on the context in which it is encountered. It’s what allows us to call upon the “right?emotional or physical response to the current encounter. A simple example, they write, is recognizing that a mountain lion seen in the zoo does not require a fear or “flight?response, while the same lion unexpectedly encountered in the backyard probably does. For someone with PTSD, a stimulus associated with the trauma they previously experienced ?such as a loud noise or a particular smell ?triggers a fear response even when the context is very safe. That’s why they react even if the noise came from the front door being slammed, or the smell comes from dinner being accidentally burned on the stove. Context processing involves a brain region called the hippocampus, and its connections to two other regions called the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala. Research has shown that activity in these brain areas is disrupted in PTSD patients. The U-M team thinks their theory can unify wide-ranging evidence by showing how a disruption in this circuit can interfere with context processing and can explain most of the symptoms and much of the biology of PTSD. “We hope to put some order to all the information that’s been gathered about PTSD from studies of human patients, and of animal models of the condition,?says Israel Liberzon, M.D., a professor of psychiatry at U-M and a researcher at the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System who also treats veterans with PTSD. “We hope to create a testable hypothesis, which isn’t as common in mental health research as it should be. If this hypothesis proves true, maybe we can unravel some of the underlying pathophysiological processes, and offer better treatments.? Liberzon and his colleague, James Abelson, M.D., Ph.D., describe in their piece models of PTSD that have emerged in recent years, and lay out the evidence for each. The problem, they say, is that none of these models sufficiently explains the various symptoms seen in patients, nor all of the complex neurobiological changes seen in PTSD and in animal models of this disorder. The first model, abnormal fear learning, is rooted in the amygdala ?the brain’s ‘fight or flight?center that focuses on response to threats or safe environments. This model emerged from work on fear conditioning, fear extinction and fear generalization. The second, exaggerated threat detection, is rooted in the brain regions that figure out what signals from the environment are “salient? or important to take note of and react to. This model focuses on vigilance and disproportionate responses to perceived threats. The third, involving executive function and regulation of emotions, is mainly rooted in the prefrontal cortex ?the brain’s center for keeping emotions in check and planning or switching between tasks. By focusing only on the evidence bolstering one of these theories, researchers may be “searching under the streetlight? says Liberzon. “But if we look at all of it in the light of context processing disruption, we can explain why different teams have seen different things. They’re not mutually exclusive.? The main thing, says Liberzon, is that “context is not only information about your surroundings ?it’s pulling out the correct emotion and memories for the context you are in.? A deficit in context processing would lead PTSD patients to feel “unmoored?from the world around them, unable to shape their responses to fit their current contexts. Instead, their brains would impose an “internalized context??one that always expects danger ?on every situation. This type of deficit, arising in the brain from a combination of genetics and life experiences, may create vulnerability to PTSD in the first place, they say. After trauma, this would generate symptoms of hypervigilance, sleeplessness, intrusive thoughts and dreams, and inappropriate emotional and physical outbursts. Liberzon and Abelson think that testing the context processing theory will enhance understanding of PTSD, even if all of its details are not verified. They hope the PTSD community will help them pursue the needed research, in PTSD patients and in animal models. They put forth specific ideas in the Neuron paper to encourage that, and are embarking on such research themselves. The U-M/VA team is currently recruiting people with PTSD ?whether veterans or not ?for studies involving brain imaging and other tests. For more information call 734-232?190. In the meantime, they note that there is a growing set of therapeutic tools that can help patients with PTSD, such as cognitive behavioral therapy mindfulness training and pharmacological approaches. These may work by helping to anchor PTSD patients in their current environment, and may prove more effective as researchers learn how to specifically strengthen context processing capacities in the brain.

A team of researchers at Aalto University asked respondents where they feel their emotions physically, and then aggregated the results. The image maps out where each emotion strikes people the strongest. The warm colors represent an increase in sensation in that area and the cooler colors mean that area is desensitized by the emotion? As you can see depression is the coldest emotion having no warmth at all.

But if fear is a natural survival response to a threat, or danger, why would we seek out that feeling?

She also teaches at Robert Morris University and Chatham University, and is the only person I’ve ever heard referred to as a “scare specialist.?Dr. Kerr is an expert in the field of fear.

74380	Fear	74380.jpg	To overcome fear you must face it. My fear was riding my bicycle in the pouring rain. That’s why I made it a personal mission to get up and ride through the pain, through the discomfort. My hands were unbearably cold. It was not easy and my stomach would turn as I walked out the door. After about two months of riding whenever it would rain I started to embrace it and understand how to handle it better. I don’t prefer riding in the rain, no where close, but when it is raining it doesn’t make me uncomfortable. I know that even through the cold rain I can still find warmth by pedaling harder and keeping my concentration on the moment rather than my thoughts.

Fear is a very useful signal along the path to freedom. The stronger the fear, the closer you are to what you are seeking. If you want to stay safe, stuck where you are, fear tells you to stop what you are doing. But if you want to be free, fear lets you know you are on the right track. It is a signal to push ahead in the same direction. To continue forward, despite everything telling you not to. Cheri Huber

81740	Fear	81740.jpg	Letterpress Workers - Fear / Available at www.draw-down.com / A blank sheet can instill fear. The fear of not knowing exactly what to do with it, the tension between keeping a fresh start and making a first move. In 2016, the concept of fear was the theme of that year’s Letterpress Workers project. An annual international gathering of print designers in Milan begun in 2012 by the Officina Tipografica Novepunti, the group’s fascination with letterpress sprung from a desire to get their hands dirty and to experience a medium of expression far away from pixels and vectors. The project was also meant to explore the role that graphic design plays in society, investigating design’s social implications, and taking inspiration from Dutch designer Willem Sandberg, whose human and professional example embodies the spirit that animates Letterpress Workers. This book gathers the work of the Fear conference, collecting prints by workshop participants, and includes texts about the history of the group and conference.

82107	Fear	82107.jpg	2.Relax. When we feel anxious, we have this almost uncontrollable urge to do something. In order to gain back control, we have to resist this urge. By resisting it, we send the signal to our bodies that everything is not, in fact, crumbling around us, but all is well. Yes, relaxing is, again, the opposite of being anxious. But what helps with this is knowing that we were never in control anyway. What will happen, will happen. So why not relax? I’d rather relax, whatever might come. Nothing’s as bad as we picture it in our minds anyway. And nothing can be worse than anxiety. So let’s choose to relax. Even while feeling anxious.

Along with the art, Feige teased a few new details about the film. He confirmed that Samuel L. Jackson will indeed be in the movie as Nick Fury ?and the usually eye-patched spy will have two eyes in the movie. The film will take place before the events of the first Iron Man movie in the early 1990s. ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

It’s a day being ill at home rather than using my ticket for the film festival. Frustrating. I’m sure reading about and the Nazis (and others pre-Holocaust when was popular in the UK and USA too) has helped my mood. Quarter of a million killed who were diagnosed. Also been reading on misuse of psychiatric meds, and moved onto About to settle in with a book about antidepressants. I’d rather be well enough to go see movies. As for me, I’m coming off my meds. Soon. Slowly.

134476	Happy	134476.jpg	to my best friend, lover and partner. I don’t want to sound too cliché about you being the love of my life and that every time I look at you, I attempt to hold back crying because of how kind you are to me, how sweet and caring you are and because of you, I’ve gotten to where I am. YET, I AM. You’ve taught me so much about patience, success and to be smart about my decisions. I fall more in love with you everyday. I was shocked I met someone like you. I was extremely distant and terrified about life, falling in love again, trying to be successful and you continued to softly tell me that everything is going to be okay. You’re the only person that has gone to EVERY fencing tournament I have, you remind me about my artwork being displayed at our favourite place everyday and to look into more venues, you NEVER yelled at me when I used to get drunk but, most importantly you supported me in becoming a better version of myself. You REALLY are my best friend. I’m grateful for you and it shocks me to this day that you chose me. Am I dreaming?!?! Is this real life?!?! Am I this fortunate?! I love you, Daniel

From what I’ve seen, it looks like their original owner died and their relatives had the job of clearing out everything in the house, including these cats. They were left outside with the trash in deplorable conditions with barely any food, no water and not even a decent place to poop. But now, they’ll be introduced to their prince charming and moving into a huge castle. They’ll be spoiled with lots of love, toys and new things! These boys are the sweetest cats I’ve ever met, it’s been wonderful watching them experience the joys of being a cat for the first time! From using an actual litterbox to being able to run around and even trying treats for the first time! It broke my heart but makes me so happy to know that they’ll be in great hands! Sorry for the long post, I’m just so happy today!
