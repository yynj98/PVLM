150	Angry	150.jpg	If you hear the loud retching of a malfunctioning gas engine in the distance, it’s probably just Leland Luca yelling at someone. His loud-raspy voice provides a stark contrast to his small stature. His desire to dominate others has led him to taking a mysterious job running errands and roughing people up for a mysterious company known as Ptah Industries. Unfortunately, only their women’s uniforms run in his size. Leland and his two younger siblings lost their mother to a savage starbat and their father to a really long cigarette errand. He left for cigarettes 10 New Luman years ago and never returned! His job allows him access to modern technology such as Tesla pistols, which he uses to do whatever the shady company asks of him. This usually involves delivering mysterious packages from one place to another, or stealing devices from people much larger than him. He traverses most of Crescent Cove on his All Terrain Airboat named Stay-Sea.

1613	Angry	1613.jpg	This honestly made me so outraged I have a lot to say. Now I’m guessing the picture has nothing to do with race (“apparently? but the “classiness?our first lady does not express unlike Jackie Kennedy. Okay first thing is first, in America we are constantly complaining how we need leaders that are so down to earth and are like us. Bullshit. Wow a woman having a good time and being normal. One shot of that and I see on face book she’s called an “ape? It does not make absolutely any sense to me. Let’s forget about how classy Mrs. Obama portrays herself to be on the regular occasion, and look at this one picture and suddenly we have the power to call her disgusting. And not to bash on Mrs. Kennedy, but oh my god. It’s practically proven your husband cheated on you and you did nothing about it. Let’s look at Michelle here, from what I know, she would not take that. God forbid we have a woman that is not afraid to be herself and not passive aggressive. God forbid we have a first lady that believes strongly in things and does something. Kennedy was from a generation where women had no say. Mrs. Obama is from a generation to try to appeal that women should have a say. And I have a feeling if she lived in the 60’s she would have plenty to say anyway. Now I could go on and on about how much this picture frustrates me, but all I’m saying is if the classiness of a first lady is all people care about and think that’s all women should be, then I’m not an American.

I had a feeling Apple store approved it because is not your average mobile app. Perhaps they did it coz we submitted it first to them instead of Google play 😛 There are plenty of apps to track your bad feelings. How about you start thinking about the good things? And whether you punish your body on a daily basis? And what do you do, when you are ANGRY, want REVENGE, or simply cannot stop our addiction or laziness? I wanted to show you how many bottled feelings we have around. Give you a bit of advice from the meltdowns I experienced. The amount of anger we hold onto is ridicolous. Going to bed before 9pm tonight coz I’m knackered 😴

6860	Angry	6860.jpg	・・? SELF DESTRUCTION - YOU’RE HEADED FOR SELF DESTRUCTION This is really deep when you think about it. I used to get angry with God when I would make poor decisions and have to deal with the consequences. I would consistently break the rules and in my arrogance, still expect a blessing. It’s no different than the child who is disrespectful, disobedient and arrogant who still expects the latest fashions, video games, shoes, transportation to basketball or dance practice AND college funding. A wise parent would not reward poor or disrespectful behavior because what is rewarded gets repeated. It wasn’t until I took responsibility for my life and my choices did things begin to change. I needed the pain of the consequences to change my choices. I hated it in the moment but I am thankful today. The pain taught me how to make wiser choices. The pain was not designed to destroy me but to change me into a maturing, responsible person. I still hear some blame God for their poor choices in a companion, friends or their poor financial decisions. They invest all of their energy playing the victim instead of owning their part and moving on. Until they take responsibility, it will be hard for things to change. This scripture simply serves as a reminder that God is not out to “get me?and if I’m not careful, I can be my own worst enemy.

Well, there is (I might make a video about this but idk rlly lol, ai’ll also link it there) buuuUuT I volunteered to make a cover for her in exchange of her crediting/shout out-ing me for tje cover but then I discovered she used my cover that I sent to her and released a new chapter without even mentioning me, believe me, I’ve been patient, thinking “Maybe she just ‘forgot’?So, I messaged her in Instagram, reminding her to credit me for the book cover I did, (It still takes me time a nd effort to do those :c) but she just ignored me, so I also commented on wattpad about the same thing but added something about me reporting her and rant to my own audience, sadly, she didn’t notice me there too, so I decided to move it and tell you guys about it :) If you think that this is petty or whatever, I dont really care right now bbs, I’ve done my part, I didnt do any shist wrong, we had an agreement. She didn’t follow. Well! That’s it for now 🌸

7030	Angry	7030.jpg	Today…was a bit of an off day for me. An understatement to say the least. I found myself getting angry like I used to over petty small things, recently I have been feeling quite “unshakeable?so why today? What was different? Well I’m still not sure but the important thing is I recognized the fact it was happening. I took a step back outside of myself and asked myself what was the purpose for today being the way it was? Well sometimes things just happen, everyone is human and no one is perfect…I mean one of the people I look up to most Tony Robbins almost died from eating too much fish…and that man has his shit together more than…pretty much anyone. The world and your path is not set in stone and no one has it all figured out. Sometimes you will get tested, and you will get angry. Just don’t lose your cool, breathe and realize the moment will pass and the problem can’t be solved by adding anger on top of it. It’s like pouring jet fuel on a fire to put it out. So enjoy this life and dont spend it full of rage, leave that to the bulls. Get Action

7650	Angry	7650.jpg	This. This makes me angry. Maybe irrationally so, but angry nonetheless. Hagrid was reckless, emotional, and a damned good person. He loved and cared for Harry, for his animals, for the people he loved, he was a protector. He was an amazing, wonderful, beautiful character. AND HE COULD GODDAMN MOTHERFUCKING SPELL. His frequent letters to Harry throughout Harry’s time at Hogwarts were not misspelled or crudely written. Yes, the book says that he has sloppy handwriting, yes many of his letters were tear-stained because he’s an emotional person. BUT THEY WERE FINE IN THE SPELLING/GRAMMAR DEPARTMENT. People like Rita Skeeter, Dolores Umbridge, and Voldemort thought that he was just some filthy half-breed, uneducated, and incompetent. But he. Was. NOT. EVEN BOOK ONE SAYS THE MESSAGE ON HARRY’S CAKE WAS “HAPPY BIRTHDAY, HARRY? NOT “HAPEE BIRTHDAE HARRY?

8139	Angry	8139.jpg	I love that the image they use is a word collage of some pretty rude and offensive things. ?Unemployment??? Something that has ALWAYS been an issue for EVERY generation??? ?Lazy?? Even though most millennials are having to work overtime if not multiple jobs to stay afloat because the baby boomers crashed the economy??? ?Selfish? Even though millennials are pushing for social justice harder than any generation ever has? ?Disrespectful? Past generations literally ENSLAVED PEOPLE, and then when that was deemed inhumane, they segregated human beings by the color of their skin?? ?Entitled? I can honestly see that one, if I’m being real. However, don’t look at us for that one. Our parents and grandparents were the ones who never wanted us to have to work for anything. They wanted us to be handed everything on a silver platter, so they instilled this preset that we deserve more than we do because, they allowed us to be brought up like that ?Lucky? Are we lucky to live in a world where a studio apartment runs between $700-$1,2000 monthly on average? Are we lucky that we might not be able to draw social security when we retire due to the baby boomers retiring and deciding that they don’t need to work for money, and they’ll try to live off of social security checks alone? Are we lucky that to get a college education we either have to completely bankrupt ourselves or be up to our shoulders in student loans? And then past that are we lucky that even if we have a fucking college degree we will still most likely have to work costumer service for years because we don’t have enough job experience in our field?? Are we lucky to live in a time where walking alone at night requires some form of self defense? Are we lucky to be brought up in the age of technology where human connection is now obsolete? Are we lucky to have the world looking down on us before we’ve even had a chance to speak up? How fucking dare you describe us like this. We will fucking show this world what we’re made of. Don’t put us down before we even learn how to stand.

8422	Angry	8422.jpg	We cling to our anger Battered and bruised. A shield to protect us From being abused. A wall that we’ve built With stones made of pain And stories so worn They all sound the same. We’re safe in our rage, Strong in our truth, Fierce in the battle Wielding our proof. Slashing, burning, cutting, churning, Hardly noticing the dead Thinking our cause Justifies any blood that is shed. No faces. No souls. Nameless people Filling holes. But the sword we wield Is double edged And with each slash Becomes deeper wedged. The anger we thought Protected us Now festers inside With rancid puss. And we stand atop Our bloody hill Safe and alone On a human landfill. Because those who dared To scale the wall Or push past our shield Were stabbed for their gall. The irony is We die all the same From the putrid wound Fed by our pain. Lay down the sword. Drop the shield. Level the wall To an open field. No backward glances No narrowed looks. Completely exposed To the enemy’s hooks. Die alone And afraid. Die together If you’re brave. J.M. Wild Art is Agnescecile Eyes by Silvia Pelissero

9573	Angry	9573.jpg	ÉNORME COUP DE GUEULE à l’approche de Noël. Comme chaque année mes punchlines “lettre au Père Noël?ont beaucoup de succès. Le cadeau “amoureux?est énormément demandé voyez vous? Bref comment voulez vous que je me fasse connaître si certaines personnes (grosses enseignes parisiennes - pour ne pas citer leurs noms) suppriment la baseline de mes punchlines??? On n’enlève pas la signature d’un tableau ou d’une livre, eh bien la punchline c’est pareil, BORDEL. Que l’on ne me cite/tag pas en commentaire je peux le comprendre?Mais supprimer ma signature c’est juste honteux. Et supprimer mon commentaire où je signale que c’est mon travail, encore plus ignoble? Je trouve cela degueulasse vis à vis des “petits artistes?qui essaie de vivre dignement avec leurs oeuvres. Parce que nous n’avons pas 3millions d’abonnés notre travail n’aurait pas le droit au respect? Voilà c’était juste pour râler un petit peu😊 Et vous remercier d’avoir troller les comptes de ces enseignes🖤💗

9817	Angry	9817.jpg	20 rebellious hip-hop flows and beats for those who dare to struggle for something better: ?The Struggle ?by AWakingDream. Includes Open Mike Eagle ≤≥ L'Orange ≤≥ Jeremiah Jae. ?You must struggle to truly remember this past in all its nuance, error, and humanity. You must resist the common urge toward the comforting narrative of divine law, toward fairy tales that imply some irrepressible justice. The enslaved were not bricks in your road, and their lives were not chapters in your redemptive history. They were people turned to fuel for the American machine?. Our triumphs can never compensate for this. Perhaps our triumphs are not even the point. Perhaps struggle is all we have because the god of history is an atheist, and nothing about this world is meant to be. So you must wake up every morning knowing that no promise is unbreakable, least of all the promise of waking up at all. This is not despair. These are the preferences of the universe itself: verbs over nouns, actions over states, struggle over hope. ? –Ta-Nehisi Coates - ‘Between the World and Me? In the same vein as this mix: awakingdreamer.com Cover artwork:

10921	Angry	10921.jpg	I really don’t like it when CBC does this, as though this and other devastating events are only tragic in the eyes of us Canadians because some of our fellow Canadians died in the incident. They do headlines like this all the time, and articles surrounding the death of Canadians in foreign happenings. I’m not saying those Canadians don’t matter and won’t be missed by their family and friends. I’m not saying it’s not awful, but the death toll is up to 59 right now. What happened doesn’t matter more to me because Canadians were killed. Before I even knew that, I was saddened to learn that people were supposed to be having fun and then this happened. Nobody should have died or been injured, okay? Not just Canadians. NO ONE.

Yes, you made me happy You made me feel loved and adored I tried new things because of you I tried to keep up with your adventurous side Tried to fall in love with the heat and the sun But it was never home with you. Home for someone like me, Is my bedroom I need the cold of the cement, the soft fabric of my blanket, and the warmth of my bed. Home is the smell of old books and written poetries, of good old music at any shop and a strong cold coffee Home is the cold in the night with stars dancing in the sky while the moon shines Home was never with you. Our indifference is an everyday torture We were never meant to be together You were never a lesson learned You’re just someone that I met on a crazy afternoon Someone that I met on a wrong day, time and place Just a chapter of my book An episode of my story Just “someone? You were my life and my world and my every thoughts, my happiness depended on you for far too long while I’m emotionally abusing you. Our relationship was toxic, a poison. I have a lot of what if’s and I should’ve. “I should’ve say no on the first day? Everything feels wrong Everything about us, every memory of you, every promises, every tears and every laughters feels fake. Everything.. was a lie. You were never a home to me, You’re just a “stop over?

11649	Angry	11649.jpg	Hudson and Melissa are finally back after a two-year absence. When we last saw them, they were together smiling [link]. After the Fedoras left their place once the lease was up following a fight between the band and the couple, both Hudson and Melissa both returned to the Army to fight overseas for their country. Unfortunately, they suffered serious injuries after crossing a landmine field. In the aftermath, Hudson became an LAE (left above elbow) amputee once he realized the injuries and blew his stack in the hospital. His wife Melissa also suffered the worst of the injuries: she lost her right leg (her last remaining leg) above the knee leaving her a DAK (double above knee) amputee along with her prosthesis, and is now wheelchair bound for life. You can tell they were absolutely furious about the state of their wounds after they were honorably discharged and after receiving a Purple Heart each.

11675	Angry	11675.jpg	Sometimes we think it’s just easier to be quiet about something if we disagree or don’t like it. But if we avoid confrontation, we share guilt in the problem. We are enabling the problem. To the extent that we are not talking to someone, we are part of the problem and have very little right to be angry as we sometimes get. As soon as we own the fact that our anger results from our not talking to someone, the confrontation goes much better. We don’t blame the other person, and we approach him from a much less angry position and have a much more “problem solving?stance. In addition, we see the conversation as helpful to the other person, as we are making him aware of a possible blind spot. The conversation becomes an effort of love, while at the same time, ridding us of our resentment so that we can love the person more freely and have a better relationship with him. ~ DR. HENRY CLOUD

Without another word spoken I saw it happen in her eyes. She had felt exactly what I wanted her to feel. She was good now. It was time to retrieve my hand.

12655	Angry	12655.jpg	My Parents Love My Younger Sister More Than Me ?Subscribe ACTUALLY HAPPENED This is Jennifer, and she has a confession to make. She’s spent a lot of time hating someone very close to her, and now she’s bitterly ashamed of herself. This is her story. She has a younger sister, Stella. She was 4 years old when her sister was born, and she remembers that she was really enthusiastic to have a little baby sister who she could play with. Well, she was still a baby herself, to be fair. But things went awfully wrong from the very beginning. Stella was born underweight and had to be kept in the hospital. She struggled for weeks, and all the family’s relatives and friends worried about her. In the meantime, Jennifer was forgotten by everyone. Just three weeks previously, she had been the center of everyone’s attention; everyone played with her and gave her presents, and now everyone was talking only about Stella ?no one even wanted to know how Jennifer was! So she found an inventive way to attract the adults?attention to herself: she threw tantrums. But her parents very soon explained to her that a tantrum doesn’t make everyone forget Stella, and that she should be less selfish. To be honest, she got very offended, but this passed totally unnoticed by everyone. When they finally brought Stella home, Jennifer felt nothing when she looked at that ugly screaming creature. She couldn’t play with her as they had promised. But at least she finally got her parents back! But no one was ready to spend all day playing with her any more ?her parents had other, more important things to do, such as taking Stella to the doctors. Jennifer had to learn to mind her own business and to live with only half of the attention that was supposed to be all hers. Then she went to school. Things didn’t improve. Stella remained a sickly child, and her parents were constantly dedicating their time, effort and money to curing one illness after or another. And all the while, Jennifer was just an ordinary kid with her school, hobbies, and friends. Her parents gave her attention, but not as much as she needed, and she solved her problems pretty much on her own. Her attitude to her parents became very bitter, and she started detesting that helpless monster of her sister. When Jennifer became a teenager, things got even worse. It was always “Stella this, Stella that? while it seemed that since she herself was no longer a child, her parents assumed their job done. She tried to rebel to get more attention, to ask for help, even to talk to them. This is when her parents explained to her that they loved her a lot, but they saw her as an independent person who didn’t need that much support. “Look Jenny, you’re strong, you can literally cope with everything! Stella is weak, she’s sick all the time, who will take care of her? But you won’t have any problems whatever the situation. We’re so proud of you!?Yeah, pride is great, but what about a bit of support? The worst episode occurred when she was due to go to a new school in another city, and therefore had to move away from her parents for the school term. She’d been asking her parents for ages to buy her a guitar. Everything seemed fine ?her sister went to school, and Jennifer thought that finally they would have a well-balanced family. She didn’t communicate much with Stella ?she had little in common with her, and wasn’t eager to talk to her when she tried awkwardly to start a conversation. And she was sure that she would get her guitar. Then suddenly Stella got some lung infection and had to stay home for a couple of months, and after that the doctors said that her parents needed to take her to the seaside to convalesce for at least a month. Guess what Jennifer got in return? “Oh sorry dear, a month at the seaside is expensive, can you wait a bit?? She was furious. Again, that little princess got everything, and now she had to leave home like a stray dog! She didn’t even try to reason with her parents that time, she just left boiling with anger and disappointment. She even imagined how wonderful life would be without Stella, and didn’t feel any sympathy towards her. Those feelings didn’t fade away during the term and she came home all bitter for Christmas. When suddenly, the time came for giving presents. And Jennifer was amazed to see Stella bring out a guitar. She couldn’t understand what was going on. She knew her parents didn’t have any money. Stella said that it was a present from her personally. She confessed that she’d felt bad for being the reason why their parents hadn’t got Jennifer her guitar, so she spent all her personal savings on one, and even did some odd jobs during the autumn to collect money. Jennifer just broke down in tears. Now she’s trying to improve her relationship with her parents and her sister. She’s learned that hating someone without really knowing them well is childish and can backfire on you. Music by Epidemic Sound: being published on

But I was so anxious and mervous but he only cracked like dad jokes like the old man he is and eased my anxiety and he was so cool and I shook hands with him and idk why he was at my school though it was like a combo of many of my schools too.

12872	Angry	12872.jpg	Although Ambrose is very sadistic, he is seldom genuinely angry. He enjoys hurting people so it’s difficult to tell the difference, but because of his sense of superiority, he doesn’t get angry easily. It’s hard to be angry with a bug. On the rare occasion that he is angry, he is terrifying. Also, something, usually something the size a town or small city, ends up in flames. This is based a bit on his backstory, but the wardrobe is wrong so it’s not really right. Ambrose’s first fledgling, Celina, was tortured brutally and killed by vampire hunters. Ambrose was unable to help her and had to watch her die. That night, the entire city went up in flames. He found the hunters most responsible for Celina’s suffering and made them suffer ten fold before killing them as well. Moral of the story, don’t make Ambrose angry. It might seem like a good idea at the time because his smug superior grin is incredibly annoying, but if he finally takes you seriously enough to be angry, you are in a bad place.

13538	Angry	13538.jpg	Wife Writes A Seriously Angry Letter To The “Other Woman…?This Is AWESOME! Dean James AMERICA’S FREEDOM FIGHTERS?Every now and then America’s Freedom Fighters likes to take a break from the every day problems we all deal with when it comes to the troubles our country and world are facing and like they say, ‘Laughter is THE BEST MEDICINE!?We hope you enjoy! Are you ready for one of the craziest craigslist letters you have ever read? This wife found evidence from the “other woman?her husband was cheating with and she writes her a vicious online letter. You might think it’s crazy, but she probably knows that her intended reader will find it for sure. What do you think? Is she justified in her response or should she take the high road and just move on? googletag.cmd.push(function() googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1489079933467-4'); ); *********************************** THANKS Jennifer?. For leaving bite marks all over my husbands chest last night. googletag.cmd.push(function() googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1489079933467-3'); ); No, really, Thank You! You have no idea what a nightmare you have just saved me and my kids from. To reward you for your services I am offering you my husband for keeps. Should you accept your prize please note the following rules. googletag.cmd.push(function() googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1489079933467-2'); ); 1. You are going to have to financially support him. I say this because we have 2 children together (but you knew that) which means that he will have to give up a sizeable chunk of his pay to support them in the manner they deserve. Please keep in mind that since he has kept me a stay at home Mom for the better part of the last 11 years he will also be paying me alimony. So forget about his money honey cause it’s mine! 2. You will have to provide him with new attire. You see after he stepped from our (now mine) shower this morning dripping wet and naked is when I discovered your little “love bites? It just so happened that at that EXACT moment a giant black hole appeared in my home and devoured almost all of his clothing. Therefore he will come to you almost naked (lucky you). The bright side is that you can dress him any way you want. Go nuts and buy him a leash and some vinyl attire or a cute little dress while your at it. 3. You will have to give him up every other weekend. This time will be set aside for his visits with his children. Since he openly admitted (in front of several people) that you are just “some dumb drunk b***h?that he met at a “tweakers?house you will be banned from these visits for fear of my children’s safety. Just so you know, that is also going to be the reason to have his visits limited (if not supervised). After all WTF was HE doing at a “tweakers?house in the first place? 4. You will not be having a proper s3x life. Yes, I know that you didn’t scr3w him last night. Since his back injury 4 years ago his “equipment?hasn’t worked right. Too bad for you because before that it was THE BEST S3X EVER and we scr3wed all the time! However, now he’ll most likely disappoint you with his half hard member that only works with a little blue pill. Please don’t let that fool you. The little blue pill means that he comes within 2 minutes?hardly enough time for you and 98% of the time he will just be too embarrassed to even try. Stock up on your batteries and/or multiple s3x partners! By the way, No it CANNOT be fixed. It’s nerve damage sweetie, deal with it! (function() document.documentElement.clientWidth)+"&referer="+referer; rcel.async = true; var rcds = document.getElementById("rcjsload_131b55"); rcds.appendChild(rcel); )(); 5. You will NOT return him to me. I will NOT have him. He messed up when he touched you! I was a good wife to him and he had a good thing going on here. Don’t be surprised if you don’t live up to me because you won’t and he will make you miserable for it! 6. He will blame you for ALL of this. He told me, with tears in his eyes, that you giggled to him “I hope your wife sees that? I don’t know if you said it or not. I don’t really care. However, just in case you did, your wish came true. I did see it, and he’s pissed. He’s so mad that you made that comment that when I punched him in the eye after he apologized to me! Yes, I know violence is wrong and to be honest I’ve never hit anyone before. However, I am not sorry that I did and if I could have that moment back I would have simply aimed lower! 7. This one isn’t really a rule, more like a friendly warning. I will make sure to take up as much of his time with the most petty crap I can find to spite you. I will make it my hobby to hurt him and you the same amount my kids are hurting right now. Please be aware that he will take it, he will deal with it for years with a smile. I was with him for 12 years, I know him better. Yes, I do feel completely justified in my actions. Just in case you were wondering. So Thank you, Jennifer the dumb drunk b***h from the tweakers house who left bite marks on my husband chest last night, for showing me that 11 years and 2 children were no match for you! I applaud you on a man well won. HE’S ALL YOURS! *********************************** WHOA! And that’s that! (h/t By Kera Osborne at Stuff Happens!)

13838	Angry	13838.jpg	8 TELLING SIGNS THAT YOU HAVE AN ATTITUDE PROBLEM. via allwomenstalk Dealing with someone with an attitude problem can be a trying and frustrating task for most people. Now what if you are the one with the attitude problem?Most of the time you may not even be aware that you are putting people off as much as you are. Here are 8 telling signs that you have an attitude problem. 1. EVERYONE SEEMS TO IRRITATE YOU If everyone around you seems to irritate you, chances are the problem is not them, it’s you. When you have a balanced and sensible view on things, you will understand that everyone is entitled to their own opinions, approaches to a task and styles of behavior. However, when you have attitude problem you will find yourself unable to tolerate the differences in other people. 2. NOTHING EVER GOES YOUR WAY Most people with a balanced view towards life understand that sometimes bad things happen and they take it in their stride. It’s the people with attitude problems that think that the universe is deliberately trying to mess up their lives when anything goes wrong. Part of being a positive individual is accepting the bad just as well as the good. 3. WHEN GOOD THINGS HAPPEN TO OTHER PEOPLE, YOU FEEL BITTER If you feel bitter and shortchanged when something good happens to someone around you, then you really have to work on your issues. Good things happening to a person is not linked to you not getting what you want. You have to find a way to be happy for other people even if you have nothing to gain from it. 4. YOU ALWAYS BELIEVE YOU ARE RIGHT Look back on all your recent arguments or discussions with the people around you and then count the number of times you were completely sure you were right. That should be an indication of your attitude. 5. YOU FIND THE CYNICAL ANGLE TO EVERYTHING If you find yourself constantly finding the cynical angle to everything, firstly you aren’t the nicest person to be around and secondly you will be full of negativity. This negativity will emerge in the form of nasty snipes and stubborn behavior, all symptomatic of attitude problems. 6. YOU REFUSE TO GIVE WAY ON ANY ISSUE It’s one thing to constantly think you’re right. It’s an even greater telling sign if you never give in during any argument or discussion. It shows that you are stubborn, unwilling to see another person’s point of view and that you have an attitude problem. 7. YOU GET EXTREMELY ANGRY WHEN SOMETHING IS AMISS Understanding and accepting that things can go wrong is part of being an adult. Reacting badly each time something is amiss is childish and once again symptomatic of a bad attitude. 8. 3 PEOPLE YOU KNOW HAVE COMMENTED ON YOUR BAD ATTITUDE Perhaps the most obvious sign is when people tell you that you have a bad attitude. If three people close to you have told you that your behavior is unbearable and that you need to improve the way you talk, it’s time to sit up and take notice. Fixing an attitude problem is easy enough but first you have to know that it exists. With the 8 signs provided above, you should be able to figure it out quickly and easily.

14539	Angry	14539.jpg	Elin Danielson-Gambogi Elin Kleopatra Danielson-Gambogi (3 September 1861 - 31 December 1919) was a Finnish painter, best known for her realist works and portraits. Danielson-Gambogi was part of the first generation of Finnish women artists who received professional education in art, the so-called “painter sisters?generation? The group also included Helene Schjerfbeck. “Whenever you are angry, take a beautiful object in your house and smash it to pieces.

25467	Bored	25467.jpg	[6.5.17] ? All I want to see is the inner beauty inside me be the first thing others see. I don’t want my sex appeal be the first thing that draws someone to like my picture. I am surrounded by photos and photos of half naked women and men. TRUST ME nothing is wrong with that at all, it’s amazing to feel empowered and love your body because I truly love and admire my own. However, vanity is a real thing. I’m going to dig deeper and challenge myself to explore what’s inside of me. Who am I really? ? What if the inner beauty was captured and featured? ? “She called to herself, day by day She called to her soul, but didn’t know what to say Start slow, as long as you start today Don’t allow this idea of this perfect self To get in your way? ?

26362	Bored	26362.jpg	Kakatapos lang umulan, tas brown out pa (welcome to Pinas! 🙄). Walang tv at internet tuloy. Kaya naisip kong balikan ang first love ko?ang pagsusulat. Dati nung kabataan ko(pero bata pa naman ako ngayon, hehe 😬) gusto kong maging manunulat, pag nakakakita ako ng papel at lapis, nagana na ang utak ko at ang dami ng gustong isulat ng mga kamay ko. Kahit ano na lang, minsan tula, minsan kwento. Minsan naman na nakakita ako ng camera, at sinubukan kong pindutin ang shutter, ayun?parang gusto ko namang maging maniniyot(ooops, tawag yan sa photographer 😆). Gusto kong kunan ang pagsikat ng araw at ang paglubog nito, gusto kong i capture ang mga alon sa dalampasigan na humahalik sa mga buhangin, ang mga ibon sa himpapawid na wari'y sinasabing masarap lumipad at maging malaya. At ngayon ngay gusto ko na lang hawakan ang mga kamay ng mga pasyente ko na nagpaparamdam sa kanila ng pag-asa, pagpaparamdam na sa bawat sakit na nararamdaman nila nawa'y ang haplos sa kamay nila ay maramdaman nila na may isang kamay na gustong pawiin ang sakit na yun. Hindi ko gustong maging isang nars, noon. Sabi ko sa nanay ko dati gusto kong maging isang astronaut. Sabi nya mga kalokohan ko daw. Weird pero yun talaga ang gusto ko noon. Mag nars na lang daw ako baka sakaling makapunta ako ang Amerika at makapangasawa ng poriner (pangarap ata ni mama maging american citizen hehe). Kaya eto naging nars nga ako pero di nga lang sa Amerika, sa Saudi naman napadpad. Sa lugar na akala ng karamihan e nakakatakot (kasi nga gawa ng mga Arabo). Nakakatakot nga din naman doon nung una pero kung nasanay ka na, wala na yung takot basta sumunod ka lang sa mga batas nila. Madaming bawal, buti na lang di bawal huminga 😂. Anim na taon din akong nagtiis sa lugar na yun. Akala ko nga dalawang taon lang itatagal ko dun. Sobrang lungkot kasi nung una. Pero nadagdagan ng dalawang taon hanggang sa dalawa pa. Hanggang sa nagdesisyon akong tumapak palayo sa matagal ko ng tinatayuang comfort zone ko. Nakakatakot umalis sa lugar na kinasanayan mo na, sa lugar na kung saan madami ka ng minahal at pinahalagahan. Pero sabi nga nila may mga bagay na kahit alam mong masakit kelangan mong iwan, kelangan mong talikuran pero di mo pwedeng kalimutan(madrama yung nagsabi nun palagay ko 😜). Naiisip ko minsan kung tama ba naging desisyon ko na umalis. Kung nag stay ba ako, mas masaya ba ako ngayon? Pinagsisissihan ko bang talikuran ang minsan naging masaya kong playground? Minsan nagsisisi din ako, pero kung di ako umalis, mangyayari ba ang mga bagay na meron ako ngayon? Ah ewan, basta ang alam ko may ilaw na. Balik muna ako sa paborito kong palabas sa tv. 🤗🤗🤗

27104	Bored	27104.jpg	Gorillaz - Plastic Beach 8.3/10 Plastic Beach is the 3rd studio LP from Gorillaz. For this album they went for more of a electronic edge, along with many guests (Snoop Dogg, Little Dragon, De La Soul, etc) this album is hard for me to decide on as its 50/50, on one hand it has some of the best tracks they have ever made and the other hand has some of my least favorites (SWEEPSTAKES). Overall this album is pretty great and I can see why it has the reputation it has 😊 Favorite Track - On Melancholy Hill Least Favorite - Sweepstakes	
27115	Bored	27115.jpg	Alt-J - RELAXER 6.6/10 As the title suggests this album is mostly to kick back to and just breathe in the sounds of acoustic guitars, and warm string sections. However this album also happens to have In Cold Blood which is their biggest and most bombastic single they’ve released. This is a pleasant experience and one worth checking out, however I don’t care for the insane and random Hit Me Like That Snare and the closure is kind of “eh? Also I’m not sure how much replay ability will come in due time. Favorite Track - In Cold Blood Least Favorite - Hit Me Like That Snare

28231	Bored	28231.jpg	On my journey to finding peace, I’ve learned to take 10-15 minutes out of my day for quiet. It doesn’t even have to be 10-15 minutes all at once, consider 5 minute breaks throughout the day. Most days, I’ll make a cup of tea, or read. I was reading this self-help book that focused on getting over the “small things.?There was a chapter that brought up how today’s society focuses itself all on technology, and it’s true. Technology has improved so swiftly in time, and sometimes we forget to pay attention to reality outside of technology. Back to the point, the chapter described how we are surrounded by technology that we simply forgot to look out a window. Allow ourselves to be bored, let your mind create new thoughts without your body being influenced with a simple distraction. Look out a window, gaze into the sun light, focus on the green trees, and all of a sudden your mind is developing new ideas and thoughts. Everyday, I chose a mindless act. Whether I’m sitting outside drinking tea, or reading a book - I’m giving myself a break from the outside world, and bringing myself back to my own. Brings me peace at mind, and allows myself to think critically and thoroughly. Try it for a time. Find your space, grab a cup of tea, and allow yourself to be bored.

32235	Bored	32235.jpg	I will never understand people that choose to sit around the house everyday. OK you have small children. Guess what there are places made just for small children..some cost money I know but if you can justify spending $60 on a cheap tee shirt and ugly leggings but not on a trip to the magic house there’s a problem? Oh those places I just mentioned are all in the city and you’re scared to drive there.. That a lame excuse BC there are these awesome things called metro link trains. You park your car and it takes you to the city. Kids love riding them and you don’t have to drive. I mean. What do I know anyway. I’m a recluse. A shut in BC I don’t have a car and none of my so called friends will drive to where I am to spend time with me. That’s what happens when. You are forced to live in small towns. No one does anything but sit around their houses watching TV.. Or going to school and watching the same 5 kids dominate sports? There is no culture here. No diversity. I’d kill myself if I could find a clean way to go and be garented my kids were taken care of. I hate it here.

33293	Bored	33293.jpg	Riverdale Riverdale has just broadcast and I want to tell you about it: It is based on a series of comics called Arhie comic: it is an American comic series, which tells the adventures of a group of teenagers called Archie, Betty, Veronica, Jughead, Reginald and Midge, among others. The characters were created by publicist / editor John L. Goldwater, screenwriter Vic Bloom, and cartoonist Bob Montana. All characters are inspired by real people. Given the popularity of the characters, Archie is also an anonymous FTP site search protocol. Veronica is also a gopher search protocol. Curious and I did not know it! The pilot of the serie is based on the strange events that happen in Riverdale (Little Town) and with them a death, that of the twin Jason Bloom that after going with his sister a day of fishing and he dies “drowned?(I never understood the version of the twin In the first chapter) and one case is in investigation because they did not find it, on the other hand there is the life of our protagonist called Archie who fights against the problems of every teenager like the university and the family business against what he wants, Betty his best friend lives in love with him and the day that was willing to declare his love; appears this beautiful spoiled girl of New York called Veronica who flees from the tragic facts family had in New York, with this brief introduction we will get to know the characters one by one in each chapter and with them new secrets unveiled and new things that you have to discover. Riverdale is a series that will leave you with many questions that you want to have an answer to. Score: 🍕 🍕 🍕

34918	Bored	34918.jpg	Let’s face it, we all have those days (or weeks, or months) when we simply don’t want to study. Even though we may love the subject, either the topic is boring, or you’re tired, or you just don’t want to study for no apparent reason. But exams ruin our lives and you need to study for them, so here are some tips to power through those terrible periods of feeling like doing nothing. <!-- more --> 1. Put on re-runs of old TV shows/movies you like (for me, it’s usually Friends.. I’ve watched it a 100 times and will happily watch it again). Since you’ve watched the episodes/movie before, you won’t feel the need to look up every second, and the sounds keep you chirpy and less tired. If you start getting too interested in the show, however, turn it off. There’s really no point. 2. Get a friend to study with you. Look for someone studious who you don’t know too well, they make the best study dates. 3. Put on music. If the words distract you, try instrumental music or even songs in another language! This too serves to keep you from falling asleep. 4. Coffee. I have advised against too much coffee in previous posts, but if you don’t consume coffee on a regular basis, that one cup can power you through your session. However, it can also over-energize you to the point you don’t wanna study, so be careful with that. 5. Throw those highlighters away. Take notes in the margins instead, it helps you actually read the stuff instead of ending up with a bunch of neon pages. 6. If you’re listening to a lecture (in class/online), take notes on a notebook instead of a laptop. Writing helps you maintain your focus and when you’re bored, doodling is a much better idea than stalking your ex’s instagram. 7. If you’re tired and keep falling asleep but really need to study, set an alarm for every 15-20 minutes. It may be annoying and slightly distracting, but at least you’re awake. Even better, actually sleep for a while and the carry on. 8. If you don’t need the internet, DON’T USE IT. There are enough applications to restrict your online use - use them. 9. Reward yourself if you accomplish your goals for the day. 10. Push through the day. If you give up once, you’ll do it again, and again, and again, till you don’t study at all. It’s happened with me before, and starting to study properly again sucks. You simply need to keep going. You can do it!

I have been trying to pave the way for your goals to be reality but I cannot help you if you all keep restricting me.

Thinking of things that need not be thought of. Has anyone an idea on how I might deal with such happenings? image/gif

42799	Bored	42799.jpg	Reporter: Victoria! Trinity! Who do you have here with you at the Premiere of Tender Nothings?! Victoria: Well this is my gorgeous Little, Becca Davenport! Trinity: Along with her lovely girlfriend, Silver. Becca: We’re so excited to be here! Victoria is the BEST Big any KAPPA sister could ask for! She has been such a great mentor and friend through my whole college experience. Silver: & were so honored that she and Trinity invited us here tonight to help support their new film. Victoria: You guys are too sweet. Reporter: I thought Bigs and Littles needed to be in the same house at the same time? Victoria: Oh, usually that is the case. However, not for mine and Bex. You see, KAPPA was such a huge part of my life, so I wanted to give back in some way. So I went back one year to see what I could contribute to better the future of my fellow sisters. Becca: I never got the chance to have a Big when I first started out in my sorority. So when Victoria came back it was my 1st run at KAPPA president. I was so nervous and overwhelmed, but thanks to Victoria, no one knew. She took me under her wing and nurtured me into a woman filled with courage and strength. So we kind of just adopted each other in the Big and Little sense. However unconventional. I still call her to this day to help when I’m in a rut. I will always be grateful to her. Silver: I will always be grateful to her as well. If it wasn’t for her and smacking some sense into my girlfriend about committing to me, I don’t know where we’d be right now! Becca: SILVER! Trinity: *snorts* if only she could have smacked herself with her own advice! Victoria: TRINI! Trinity: *laughing* I think that’s our cue! Thank you for the interview, but we must really get to our seats now. Reporter: Thank you ladies! Have a wonderful premiere. Ladies: Thank you!

It’s a little weird since I’m still a beginner with digital art and clearly this is not grade-A art- But-! His name is Mikey! He’s a tall nerd in his senior year of high school. He’s 18 and is daiting a girl named Katie (who is a year older than him, from failing a grade-) He’s clingy and adorable and their relationship is pure- I’ll repost this later with Katie, maybe drawing them together??

With work punishment of you can’t drive without a supervisor in the vehicle with you, bulls**t since both have received multiple tickets in the last year and I haven’t gotten any but that’s the way it works at my job. So today I will probably do some of the same with the exception of getting ready for my monthly Pathfinder meet. Hopefully I won’t get to bored today but who knows.

Flying must be nice. If only I had wings.?Urania looked thoughtfully at the soft-looking-substance. Oh, but didn’t they see? ‘The clouds aren’t dancing, they are running away from the Sun. Trying to escape the impossible, because it seems possible to them, which isn’t. Hoping that the Moon could refuge them for a while, but afterwards they would be on their own again.? Oh, but didn’t they know? ‘Flying is no gift: it’s a curse,?Melpomene told them grimly. ‘Once floating in the air and approaching the Sun, because the orb seems so pure, you’ll realize in agony that flying will be your death. The cold of the air that brushes your skin, will feel warmer and warmer. Cozier than before. The Sun Rays will fill you up with bliss. “Heavenly,?you would mutter. With each beat of your wings, the Sun will seem to be closer to you than before. “Further I must go,?you would exclaim, blinded by the love of the wonderful feeling. Oh, but sweetie, you forgot. We’re humans, we aren’t made to fly as birds do in the sky. Oh, but honey, you forgot. You fly to close to the Sun and you’ll die. You’ll be your own Icarus, dooming yourself to the love of the height. The Love for the Sun.? ?peach queen aka M.J.

47095	Calm	47095.jpg	Happy Tuesday!!! This is a great quote. It’s great to remember. My life is rough, a lot of people’s lives are rough, but there is always something to be grateful for. Honestly, everyone should be grateful for simply having a new day of life. I am incredibly grateful for everything I have and to still be living and getting slowly stronger. God truly is working miracles and really is looking after me. I am determined to stay relaxed and continue getting stronger!!! I pray you all have a blessed, relaxing, and grateful day!!! :) 😊😄🙏🏻😍💖	
47118	Calm	47118.jpg	My national novel writing month book ended up being an emotional retelling of the early period of my first marriage. This thought came up in a meditation as I was in the process of writing it and it really struck me. When I was married to the ex, he made me give up almost all of my own friendships. I was only able to be friends with the people he found for me to be friends with. This was the catalyst to some great friendships that I still have to this day and I’m grateful for those. But he really felt the need to possess me completely in order to feel secure in my love for him. This is just one example. But it expresses this mediation thought perfectly. Honestly, writing the novel this month has been so informative for me. There are so many things I have never talked about or written about before, things I’ve buried really deeply inside of myself. It’s been interesting because I’m writing it from three perspectives, the wife, the husband, and a third person narrator. It’s really helped me to be able to climb inside his shoes and try to make sense of these actions. And though the book is never going to see the light of day, it’s been really cathartic for me to write. FREEDOM was my second One Word 365. It was the year after my divorce was final and it was the thing that I wanted desperately. I never really understood why I needed it so desperately until I began to write the novel this month. Freedom is Love. KTBSPA! -Lindsey	
47140	Calm	47140.jpg	And soon it did JMT DAY 13 - SALLIE KEYS LAKES AT SUNSET Sallie Keys Lakes at sunset Sallie Keys Lakes consisted of two lakes - first lake (to south bounders - east lake) and second lake (west lake). The view of the first lake, partially surrounded by dense forest, in the company of Mt. Henry (12,202?, part of Le Conte Divide, in the far distance, was simply spectacular as on our way down from Seldon Pass. The second, sitting behind the forest, was hardly visible. I pitched my tent a little bit away from the site where my JMT buddy Henry did with an intention of staying close the second lake so that I didn’t have to walk a lot between the two lakes. With my camera gear, I went down the rocky slope and soon re-joined the main trail which led me to the little stream connecting the two lakes. At first I considered setting up my camera on the west side of the lake but quickly decided to go against it because of the sunset glow expected to be cast on Mt. Senger (12,286? and its ridge line. So, instead, I was settled along the shore about 100 feet down from the stream. The long ridge line stretched as far as I could see with its reflection in the water just pleased my eye. Unlike the first, the second lake was very calm, thanks to the dense forest that divided the two. Then, it was just a matter of waiting for the orange glow to descend upon the ridge line. And soon it did. Sallie Keys Lakes, Sierra National Forest, CA (at Sierra National Forest)

48833	Calm	48833.jpg	🗨? Previously in my life I’ve tried meditating probably couple of hundreds of times. Never seem to the get the grip of it, to focus, to concentrate, to feel relaxed. # Ironically, my previous attempts to meditate caused me even more stress. But this is not an anomaly, or a paradox. It was a process, that I never fully grasped. # However, thanks to brilliant apps such as Headspace and Calm, I’ve been successfully and mindfully (pun intended) meditating for, give or take, a year. # And it all started with a few simple steps that I’m going to recommend you following: # 1. Install either Headspace or Calm on your smartphone. I would recommend both, for variety sake. # 2. Follow their programs on a DAILY basis. Consistency is the key with many things in life if you chase success, but in the case of meditation it’s even more prominent. # 3. Realize that you shouldn’t master it at first. Don’t expect entering some kind of a psychedelic zen mode. It’s all about focusing on on your breath, while being completely aware of the moment. Observe your thoughts and, in time, learn how to let them go. # 4. Also realize it will only take ~10 minutes of your time. You can find or create that time. # 5. Feel free to message me if you need any help with it. And I would love if - after certain period of time - you let me know how it goes and what are you experiencing through mindfulness and meditation. # I generally recommend this to a lot of my clients that are under chronic stress and/or have a problem coping with the acute stress and impulsive reacting. # Meditation certainly has a powerful positive impact on my sleep, stress levels, emotional state, and on quality of life in general. # ✔️

[I do this every day] I have been obsessed with business books over the past few years- I love gaining knowledge on how I can run my business better and be of greater service across all my jobs. Lately, however, I have been questioning the relevance of what I do with all the turmoil in the world- does fitness really matter when people are dying, where there is so much hate, when it seems like all we really need is MORE love, kindness and humanity in the world?(i could go on forever). JOY My children are my joy- pure, unrelentless joy?But I needed an input of relevance positive information amongst the sadness and chaos I see in the world. So I picked up a new book last week: The Book Of Joy. This book is an intimate look at the conversations between His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu on the conversation of JOY. ⭐️⭐️⭐️ MEDITATE The Dalai Lama shares a little about his 5, yes FIVE HOUR practice of DAILY meditation. He rises at 3am to meditate for 5 hours straight. This is probably why he is one of the greatest holiest spiritual leaders of our time, but he shares the scientific evidence that grounds the practice of meditation in truth and relevance that many people seek to validate the rationale behind doing something. He shares that meditation “allows your mind to settle inward, beyond thought, to experience the silent reservoir of energy, creativity and intelligence found within everyone ?a natural state of restful alertness.?

50612	Calm	50612.jpg	Yesterday I spent time in the yard🌱. I find it’s theraputic to be with Mother Earth🌎, to get my hands dirty, to see something through to completion. I planted a rose🌹 bush in memory of my Dad (seen in the background) and while digging I found this milky quartz💎! Milky, Quartz also known as Snow Quartz or Quartzite, is an opaque white quartz; it is supportive for lesson learning, realizing limitations and utilizing tact. It is also a stone that brings good fortune, is a calming and soothing stone & is helpful for meditation📿, and looking within. Anyway, I felt it pretty rad that the Universe gave me such an appropriate gift. And today has been really awesome, thank you all for the sweet words. ❤️❤️❤️

50725	Calm	50725.jpg	God will answer your prayers on His own time. If you’re anything like me, waiting for the Lord’s response will cause you to LOSE YOUR MIND! So instead of praying for answers, ask the Lord to grant you with the peace to deal with your situation (until He is ready to give you an answer). In the meanwhile, continue to seek Him through prayer and studying the word. Trust me, your prayers will not go unanswered…your answer is on its way. Also, be sure you are in a great spiritual place so that you may hear Him when He’s giving you your answers. Don’t miss what the Lord has for you! -G

I often feel uncomfortable and catch myself trying to escape conversations, or even avoid leaving the house altogether. This essential oil Sacred Arrow bracelet is made with hematite, which is known to connect us with our surroundings and give us confidence. It helps keep positive thoughts in my head, and helps me get through the day with a strong mind and a smile on my face. My bracelets are handmade with black lava beads that absorb the oil, so you can use them on-the-go. Just put a little bit of oil on the beads, let it soak in, and the oil lasts all day.

51455	Calm	51455.jpg	Nora ‘Bondi beach. My feet in the sand. Heat across my back. The smell of the ocean. Sun so bright I have to close my eyes against the glare. I’m a perfect temperature of warmth. I feel light, but grounded. I feel a total sense of belonging. This is my happy place. This is where I go to when I meditate?so I guess this is my Third Place??she says laughing. Listening to Nora describe how she feels in this happy place, a profound sense of serenity comes over her. Nora suffers from anxiety, so this Third Place is a trusted ally she returns to when things feel too suffocating. ‘I rely on mediation and returning to this happy place to keep my mind calm.? We talk a while about other answers I’ve been given when discussing Oldenburg and this concept. We get to questioning how Third Places might differ for people who have a dominant left- or right-brain. As a scientist, Nora suggests it might be easier to find a Third Place if you have a clear means of creative expression ?as a musician, a writer or a painter. But in a field such as hers, and with a more analytical way of expressing herself, is it harder to find that perfect Third Place?

Sometimes all we need is a calm morning to reflect and move within, to mentally and physically remove ourselves from the future and the past, to just be.

51840	Calm	51840.jpg	When The World Feels Upside Down, Give This Meditation A Try Mind Body Green writes: Have you ever had your world turned upside down? Have you ever questioned everything you thought to be true? It’s a scary place to be, isn’t it? When this happens, it feels like everything has changed from one day to the next. Yesterday you went about your day, made your plans, and felt that you had a pretty firm grasp on where you stand. You felt surrounded by people who were moving in the same direction as you. But today, you don’t recognize anything or anyone around you. The wind has been knocked out of you. The ground has been pulled out from beneath you. The world is unfamiliar. Alien even. Suddenly you’re not so sure where you’re going or who’s with you. You go about this day in a fog. You can’t see a foot in front of you, and you wonder how you will ever muddle through. And through all of that fear and doubt, all of the disorientation and disorder, you wonder how you will ever find peace. Keep Reading.

52586	Calm	52586.jpg	?Quietly and Clearly on 8tracks ? A playlist for being at peace with the chaos filled with upbeat but calming songs. Blurry photo of Cincinnati at night by me. Man on Fire - Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes 17 - Youth Lagoon Dissolve Me - alt-j Dimming Light - Tennis Forrest Gump - Frank Ocean Girl From the North Country - Bob Dylan ft. Johnny Cash Dog Days Are Over (MTV Unplugged Version) - Florence + the Machine On the Sea - Beach House IPlayYouListen - ODESZA Who Knows Who Cares - Local Natives (acoustic in the streets of Paris ft. v nice echoes)Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism. Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass. Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.

Es ese azul que inspira porque también tiene sonido. Y aroma. A qué huele el azul? Huele a mar y sabe a sal. Es el color de la inspiracion en los momentos débiles. Es el color del perdón en las discusiones. Los “me too?que acompañan a los “I love you? El color de los sueños que nos atrapan y nos persiguen hasta cumplirlos.

55890	Calm	55890.jpg	Letting go has never been my strong suit. It contributes hugely to my anxiety because it gives me so many things to think about at all times. But the real reason letting go is so hard for me is because in my mind, letting go means losing control. I do not like to do that. Last year during One Word 365, I spent the year focusing on peace. How to find it, already having it inside me?but I never examined it from the perspective of needing to let go in order to have it. This image came from one of my recent meditations and in it I can really see the concept of meditation. The first thing people tell me about meditation, after they’ve tried it, is how hard it is to silence the mind. This I totally get. In silencing your mind, you must be willing to let go of everything you’re thinking about in order to find peace. It’s tough to turn everything off in order to focus on nothing. For me, it’s easier to let go of the small things. But that means that it’s the big, huge, life-altering things that I am unable to let go of. It’s hard for me to sit down and not have twenty-seven things on my mind at one time. And therefore, it’s hard for me to ever truly know peace. I feel as though I’ve come leaps and bounds in the area of peace, especially since journeying with it via One Word last year. But this is one area where I find that I fall short repeatedly. I think one of the things that I’ve learned through that process as well as through meditation is that that’s okay. Over the years, letting go has become easier for me. I still wouldn’t call it a strength, but I’ve begun to understand my own limits and set boundaries for myself. I think so much of it is really about the striving - if I work toward letting things go, then I am ultimately working toward peace. KTBSPA! -Lindsey	
55900	Calm	55900.jpg	The clouds shown me the peace. A calm during the storm. A moment where I was able to stare at the eye and raise my hand with pride. Power surged through me, grounding me into my foundation. Prepared I have become and experience has built the walls around my heart to push through the darkness that plagues my soul. Not a cure but a remedy to continue throughout this horrid life……?.

57147	Calm	57147.jpg	?WHO TELLS THE TRUTH ? •Kids can’t fake responses to treatments given. Not toddlers or any child that doesn’t know any better. So when a child is experiencing a significant change in their behaviour, there is no question in my mind that we have a formula that is life-changing, not just for kids, but for everyone. ?This is one of the reasons why I am loving the results I’m hearing from parents of kids. They range from kids being able to concentrate more, kids that are less defiant, kids are eating more, playing well with others, playing well alone, to a complete change in behaviour where some parents are hoping they do not need chemical meds that have so many adverse side effects. ?Kids cannot fake their responses nor can they have a placebo effect. Their results are true blue. Their results are legit. Especially when they have no clue they are being given something to help with their behaviour. Message me if you think your child can benefit from something natural, scientifically proven, safe for kids to adults, with 70 years of research by 1200 scientists. Feb 1st

58646	Calm	58646.jpg	Wow she has taken her arsenal out 😱😻 I must admit I haven’t done my homework to watch her Zumba videos properly (I prefer the live version 😄) so I never quite learn “Warano style?moves but they are awesome & I’m already thinking about the song 👯‍♀?I just watched it but it doesn’t make her justice 😌 The moves remind me of another great song “Black widow? love the boxing upperbody rotation 😃 I was surprised w an old song I never danced, I just googled “Got to love you?lyrics, I didn’t know it was Sean Paul I was struggling to understand the weird lyrics but thankfully someone translated them 😅 It had a nice sassy move 😸 I was thinking to rest tomorrow & meditate as the week is getting harder but no chance I’m totally hooked w today’s surprise dances 🙆🏻‍♀?Life is a party at last 😄 Yest in Zumba I saw one of my hairdressers pick up her daughter from school, such a small world. She said how long have you been doing it? ?.5 years, you should try, she’s amazing? I’ve been telling my hairdressers to try it but they are the ones moaning it’s expensive 😒 I’d happily pay £10 or more even, she’s too cheap for what she delivers, but people is stingy for their health..I also told 2 colleagues but full of excuses.. I wished I could show them a video, but videos hardly do any justice. When teacher comes off stage to dance “Nagada Sang Dhol"½ of the class faces the other & we all coordinate not to hit each other. All the newbies are surprised & I bet they have never seen anything like it. Such a powerful song, dance & energy ❤️ I think it’s her choreos that got me onto Latin music. It’s impossible I would have liked it so much otherwise! Even my sister noticed my taste changed. Beto is in my mind, & Jlo w her "y el anillo pa cuando?chorus 👯‍♀️💎?I nearly got the choreo 😊 I was cold today but I should have known, tshirt in Zumba = boiling 😅 no matter what: sleveless tops.

I have an workshop coming up on Sunday, May 20th details/info: Book now, space is limited, please treat Yourself & come join me for an afternoon to De-Stress, Balance, Renew & Recharge & then continue the Vibe with coloring!!! Light refreshments will be served. If You cannot attend why not consider booking a session? StressBusters Guided Meditation is available in Private, Group & Remote sessions And…for further inspiration, here’s what a guest had to say about one of my workshops: “I recently attended Jacquie’s StressBusters workshop. What a wonderful experience. The event was a mix of meditation, collage, healthy snacks, and most importantly, great women and conversation. The other attendees all knew each other, which can be daunting to join as the stranger, but I felt welcome from the moment I entered. Jacquie has a special energy around her; she’s warm, nurturing and inspiring. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience. I walked in the door stressed and overwhelmed, and left recharged with the clarity I needed.? Photography: Solwazi Afi Olusola _ _ _ _ _

It’s the mind gathering a database on the wonders of the world and Logan utilizing his best knowledge to ensure his loved ones live a long, healthy life. It’s morality teaming up with the heart to make the world a better place and Patton making a sanctuary to surround his loved ones in warmth and safety. It’s anxiety looking behind every shadow to deter all threats and Virgil being the armor that takes the dents so his loved ones don’t have to. Because love is the reason why different personalities can come together and learn to value each other’s worth.

I used it sporadically before, but am now trying to make it a regular practice. One feature I’m enjoying is a new 10 minute meditation released every day on a different topic. They’re short, and great on my commute. Today’s meditation was about cultivating a loving heart towards yourself and others. This is my wish for you today.

It is no more. It has served its purpose. Let this renewal, seep into our deepest self, all our relationships, all our interactions, all that we are broadcasting out there, and above all let us rise to our highest soul self, as the Divine intended, to become a great blessing of Love, Power and Wisdom. May the Rain of Blessings pour upon you and yours and may Eternal Love, and Light give you the power to find your wings to fly and soar, higher than ever before! Happy Easter! Or whatever day it is you are celebrating in your own way. (Judith Kusel)

60113	Calm	60113.jpg	Here’s one from my new line of Inspirational Mandalas - mandalas featuring inspirational prayers, blessings and mantras. Although I am by far “not a Christian?I have always loved the Serenity Prayer. Not only because it is wise, simple and profound but because it can be reduced to those three simple words - SERENITY - COURAGE and WISDOM - which can be chanted like a mantra to bring calm and peace, focus and grounding to any situation that we might find stressful of challenging. Give it a go now - gaze at the mandala - read the prayer through once slowly allowing its wisdom to sink in and then chant the keys words, allowing your eyes to blur and shut as you centre in on the now! Blissful serenity!

He won’t let someone suffer forever. I truly believe that for me. In my 20 years of life so far I have already been through so much, good and bad. And God has helped me through it all. I know He won’t let me hurt forever. Everyone just has to have faith!!! I pray you all have a blessed and great day!!! 😊😄🙏🏻💪🏻💖

60224	Calm	60224.jpg	**see the post in Engl. after the Rus. one ? На фото - сухумский в октябре. Пустынный пляж - особая романтика, особенно если знаешь его людным и оживленным. Он как-то настраивает на задумчивость и спокойствие. Трудно в толпе думать о чем-то серьезном - постоянно что-то отвлекает. А в уединении тихой аллеи, нешумной улочки или вот такой вот опустевшей набережной и планы на ближайшее будущее легче обдумать, и о вечном подумать, и вообще - провести оптимизацию в мыслях и чувствах. А вы любите оставаться в тишине? И - Всем хорошей недели! 🌞💎🌅 It’s Sukhum last on the photo here. There is something in empty beaches, alleys or quiet streets. They give a special calm & thoughtful mood. It is difficult to think about something serious in a crowd. But in privacy I can to think about the closest plans or about eternal things; generally, to make an optimisation in thoughts & feelings. And You - do You like to stay in silence? Anyway: Have a good week! (at Набережная Махаджиров. Абхазия, Сухум)

61106	Calm	61106.jpg	If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. 1 Corinthians 13:1 You inspired me Lord in loving. The Love you exampled did not chose whom to love. May in everything I will do, especially to others and my daily living, love is present, not that they are loveable but because I love you and that you love me very much first. Nothing wrong in loving. Do it for God, to gloriy Him.	
61107	Calm	61107.jpg	APPROACH THIS DAY WITH AWARENESS OF WHO IS BOSS. As you make plans for the day, remember that it is I who orchestrate the events of your life. On days when things go smoothly, according to your plans, you may be unaware of My sovereign Presence. On days when your plans are thwarted, be on the lookout for Me! I may be doing something important in your life, something quite different from what you expected. It is essential at such times to stay in communication with Me, accepting My way as better than yours. Don’t try to figure out what is happening. Simply trust Me and thank Me in advance for the good that will come out of it all. I know the plans I have for you, and they are good. “For I know the plans I have for you,?declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.? —Jeremiah 29:11

Thank you Lord amen. We are free brother. Let us praise the Lord for it.

61159	Calm	61159.jpg	I AM LEADING YOU ALONG THE HIGH ROAD, but there are descents as well as ascents. In the distance you see snow-covered peaks glistening in brilliant sunlight. Your longing to reach those peaks is good, but you must not take shortcuts. Your assignment is to follow Me, allowing Me to direct your path. Let the heights beckon you onward, but stay close to Me. Learn to trust Me when things go “wrong.?Disruptions to your routine highlight your dependence on Me. Trusting acceptance of trials brings blessings that far outweigh themall. Walk hand in hand with Me through this day. I have lovingly planned every inch of the way. Trust does not falter when the path becomes rocky and steep. Breathe deep draughts of My Presence, and hold tightly to My hand. Together we can make it! The Sovereign Lord is my strength; he makes my feet like the feet of a deer, he enables me to go on the heights. —Habakkuk 3:19

61918	Calm	61918.jpg	And we fall. From the unexplainable joys, Which we are unashamed to feel, To idleness. The unimpassioned Or mundane Feelings that we believe to be our lows That are normal occurances Disguised as the unnatural. We fall And then we rise again, Because we do not live on an incline But rather a forward moving seesaw That is wild and unpredictable, And human. // Photo and poem - Utopiyll

61977	Calm	61977.jpg	I love this quote I found today. Things have been really stressful already today. I hate when either of my parents are in a bad mood. It’s been happening a lot lately and it really affects me. In the heat of the moment it’s hard to step back and realize that they don’t mean anything they say and eventually it’ll blow over. I know I deserve to be happy and I don’t deserve to be abused in any way. And sometimes I don’t think my parents even realize what they’re doing or saying to me. I guess they’re just venting but, especially my mom, always takes her anger and negative emotions out on me. It’s actually quite heartbreaking because she’s my mom. Her and I have always been close. It’s hard to grasp the fact that she would say hurtful things to me in a fit of anger. And it’s almost impossible to block it out because when my parents are mad they’ll follow me around and criticize me and yell at me. It also makes me think nothing I do is good enough for them. That’s kind of how it seems. Yes, I do meditate regularly but as soon as I’m done and I come back to “reality?the stress continues. I will try my best to block it out and take it easy. I pray you all have a good and relaxing day!!! 😔😣🙏🏻❤️💖

62310	Calm	62310.jpg	MONDAY MUSE: IMPERMANENCE - Change or impermanence is the essential characteristic of all phenomenal existence. We cannot say of anything, animate or inanimate, organic or inorganic, “this is lasting? for even while we are saying this, it would be undergoing change. All is fleeting; the beauty of flowers, the bird’s melody, the bee’s hum, and a sunset’s glory. No race, creed, or civilization has ever lasted nor will there ever be. We are all spiritual beings having a human experience. All ideas about fixing the world, eradicating evil, or establishing your version of justice amount to the ripples in water, or the flickers of a candle’s flame. Nothing lasts except the ever rippling river of change. If this is so, and science is confirming this everyday, the best thing we can do as humans is learn how to swim!

63453	Calm	63453.jpg	Happy Sunday and happy I am incredibly grateful and thankful and amazed at how many people have been telling me how good I look. I am still in shock and awe at the miracle it is that God is slowly healing me. Once I hit my near-death point in the spring, at just the right moment God stepped in and somehow changed something in my mind and my body. I slowly was able to deal with my stress and anxiety better. I in turn slowly started having more of an appetite. I started realizing I could do things I haven’t been able to do in years. I’m super happy because God has given me the strength to swing and clean and run across cross-walks. God, how I’ve missed it. I am determined that one day I will even be able to do splits again and walk 8 miles. I have faith in God!!! I pray you all have a blessed, relaxing, and grateful day!!! :) 😊😄🙏🏻😍💖

64922	Calm	64922.jpg	For those who believe in the book “the secret? here is my story 😄 I once went to that bridge and I caught a sunset spontaneously. Despite driving through there for 3 years, it was only then I noticed what a beautiful sight there was ian summer time after work. I never had the courage to stop alone. One of my favourite authors Fannie Flagg in her book “I cannot wait to get to heaven? said they had a sunset club. I loved the idea but I never did anything but wishing away one day I’d enjoy sunsets regularly. Fast forward 4 years, my landlord sold the house and I had to move fast. I found an amazing flat with views to that very bridge and river from the living room!!! It was only 2.5 months but boy I enjoyed quite a few sunsets, still alone, my next wish will be to see them with someone special 😊☺️ I’d like you to reflect, when you press like, do you have a hidden agenda and expect the person to like your picture or follow you back? I used to feel that way, until I realised it’s an ego trap. The idea of instagram is to share pictures, if you decide to like it it’s lovely to let someone know their picture touched you. If they don’t like your pictures or follow you back there are 2 clear reasons, first one instagram is limited so you can only see 100 notifications from what I have seen. When you have so many pictures and likes the feed goes mental so not sure how I had 200 followers then went back to 125. I have not seen these people come and go other than by the numbers 🤔 I am not after likes/followers. I want to share my pictures, and web, if I find yours that will be destiny’s mysterious ways 🕉🙏🏻. Ah second one coz they have no idea what your profile is about or they don’t have time/battery/wifi! Ps my feed has gone mental so getting notifications with a lot of delay 🙀

65076	Fear	65076.jpg	I must say a word about fear. It is life’s only true opponent. Only fear can defeat life. It is a clever, treacherous adversary, how well I know. It has no decency, respects no law or convention, shows no mercy. It goes for your weakest spot, which it finds with unnerving ease. It begins in your mind, always ?so you must fight hard to express it. You must fight hard to shine the light of words upon it. Because if you don’t, if your fear becomes a wordless darkness that you avoid, perhaps even manage to forget, you open yourself to further attacks of fear because you never truly fought the opponent who defeated you. “We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.??Plato

65086	Fear	65086.jpg	People who accomplish big things in life must face naysayers who try to discourage them. 👉🏻When the Wright brothers tried to fly their first plane, people told them it would never work because humans can’t fly. 👉🏻When Moses led the Israelites across the desert, the people complained: “We’re going to die! We want to go back to Egypt!? 👉🏻When John F. Kennedy said the United States would send a man to the moon, many people said it could never be done. Anyone who has ever tried to do anything great has always come face-to-face with naysayers. The thing is, naysayers aren’t necessarily bad people. They may truly want what’s best for you. They may love you. But they’re not God ☝? So don’t treat their opinions like you would God’s opinions. The Bible says, “The fear of human opinion disables; trusting in God protects you from that?(Proverbs 29:25 MSG). Some of us have been disabled by the opinions of others and we don’t even realize it. In a sense, some of us have become addicted to the approval of others. Another translation of Proverbs 29:25 says, “It is dangerous to be concerned with what other people think of you, but if you trust the Lord, you are safe?(GNT). When you give more weight to the opinions of others than you do to God’s opinion, you’ll stay on the sidelines when God wants you in the game. You’ll stay locked up in a prison of self-made fear. Other people’s opinions can sidetrack you from God’s purpose for your life. Don’t let that happen. In Isaiah 8:13, the Bible says, “The Lord Almighty is the one you are to regard as holy, he is the one you are to fear, he is the one you are to dread?(NIV). So break the chains of fear and go after God’s vision for your life. He’s your biggest cheerleader. He wants you to succeed, and he’s working in your life so you will.

Personally I have learned to take the big picture and break it down into small manageable parts. The circumstances in my life dictated my emotions and created a disconnect between myself and the ones I love ❤️. I learned to minimize the negative impact of my fears by addressing the concerns immediately. It is only through quieting the mind that one can truly be lead by the Creators Divine guidance. Mediate to slow your conscious minds obsessions and free your inner truth. Remember the truth shall set you free. The truth will break away fear and let you see through the illusions of this world.

66593	Fear	66593.jpg	Life_Lesson_301_October 28th 2018 Today came across this wall in Houston and got solution to a problem which was bothering me since few days. Let me share. Since few days I was wanting to discuss something with my husband but somewhere was afraid that may be he rejects my idea. What if he says NO. Was trying to dig his thoughts indirectly to understand his opinion. But when looked at the wall, found it so difficult to read it. And realised that if this was written in straight line, would have been easier to read through. Came to a conclusion that why do we complicate our lives by turning the situations upside down. Why are we fearful? It’s better to come to the point directly instead of creating complexities for ourselves and others. My message to all ?Never be fearful to express your thoughts with a fear of rejection instead face it?

66676	Fear	66676.jpg	While chatting with a medium, we briefly discussed why I don’t hear spirits like she does very often. I get more of a mental blip where ideas come to me rather than having a conversation. I’d much rather have the conversation so I could be more helpful. I know spirits come to me for help but I rarely know consciously what they want. She offered to pay me for my time, but I said if she wanted to do something for me, see if she can find out what I need to do to be able to hear better. Since then I’ve given some thought to it and I’m thinking perhaps something happened when I was very young. When I was a wee tyke I had mostly bad experiences with spirits. That I can recall anyway. I don’t remember having good ones except with the nature spirits when I’d play in the bushes and trees near houses. I lived in a ghetto and at night, the spirits were more interested in terrifying me than communicating. I clearly remember many times laying in bed screaming for my mom to come rescue me - and that was if I wasn’t so frightened that I couldn’t make a sound. Eventually she ignored me, but I had our family cat to keep me company and purr. I think as a child I may have ‘plugged my ears?in defense and I’ve never learned to open them up again - maybe. I hear voices once in a great while, so I know there’s conversations going on, but apparently I’m all fucked up in that way and I’ll have to get some help. As an example, I recently heard a female voice say “I can’t…?and then my spiritual hearing shut down. It’s frustrating as hell because consciously I DO want to communicate. Facing my fears hasn’t helped yet as I can sit surrounded by entities and speaking out loud to them and feeling them respond - but I don’t hear any responses, I can hear them make things “go bump in the night,?but no habla.

A segment of that loop is on the spotify track. I don’t like it. The loop is really weird and it scares me. But a lot of things scare me, so it’s okay because I’m used to it. So as such, I drew this.

66752	Fear	66752.jpg	Do you ever get stuck in fear mode? Knowing you want to achieve your goals but let fear hold you back from doing the things or because of the unknown? People that achieve great success in anything they do is because they first have a choice and in that choice they choose to take action and take chances. Those chances make changes and change is where you see success in your life. Don’t be paralyzed by the fear that is only created by yourself. It’s like the boogie man under the bed. Sit at the edge of your bed, dangle your feet, place them on the ground, get out of bed, lay on the ground and look under your bed. There is no boogie man. Do don’t fear something that isn’t real!! Make your choices, take a chance and make a change. (at Park City, Utah)

The owner of the retreat I’m at lends his body to spirits. The spirits gives us advice on what to do with our matters. I know it totally sounds crazy to western people. The spirits can tell you to do different things, meditate, give you herbs or send you to a spiritual operation. I had no idea that we got to ask three questions when I got here, so I’ve spent most of my yesterday thinking -why I’m here? 6 months ago when I was reading about this, I just felt that this might help me get rid of resistance. I never thought for a million years that I would actually take my ass to middle the of Brazil far away from my family and their approval to talk to spirits. But here I am and now I must seas this opportunity. Let go of fear and jump! Namaste 🙏🏽 (på/i Casa Dom Inácio de Loyola)

67079	Fear	67079.jpg	Our week in Stowe, Vermont didn’t turn out as planned?on the first day at the end of our snowboarding lesson, Brian fell weird and fractured his fibula bone by his ankle. Our week of snowboarding, sledding, snowshoeing, and exploring quickly changed with a boot and crutches! We came home early but here’s my takeaway? To live your life in fear of getting hurt, falling, or even failing is no life at all. I was scared out of my mind on that board but I did it anyway and I’m so proud that I did. Yes, I fell. Yes, I collided with a skier. Yes, I was going slower than most 3 year old children. And yes, I was scared but you know what else I felt? Pride. Strength. Courage. Adrenaline. Badass. And a rush of how awesome and beautiful life truly is when you really live it. I wouldn’t trade that feeling for anything. And, you know what? Brian wouldn’t either. He didn’t regret trying even though he got injured. I feel like sometimes the fear of getting hurt is worse than when it actually happens! Don’t live your life in fear of the what ifs. Be smart, follow your heart, and do those things that scare you! Everything amazing in my life has come from saying yes to something unknown and scary. Unfortunately, we didn’t even get a snowboarding selfie! I asked my instructor to take this one of me on my way to the lodge medic to be with Brian. We’ll get back out there next season and try it again. No regrets. Follow your fear! (at Stowe Mountain Resort)

67146	Fear	67146.jpg	How the Brain Remembers Fearful Experiences Understanding how the brain remembers can one day shed light on what went wrong when memory fails, such as it occurs in Alzheimer’s disease. Researchers at Baylor College of Medicine and Rice University reveal for the first time the specific patterns of electrical activity in rat brains that are associated with specific memories, in this case a fearful experience. They discovered that before rats avoid a place in which they had a fearful experience, the brain recalled memories of the physical location where the experience occurred.

Love doesn’t always have to be the kind we see in movies. Love can be as simple as extending it to your friends and the people around you. Loving others well is something I think we can all get a little better at! Worldly love is no match against godly love. The Bible talks about this perfect love that God gives to us, and tells us how we too can show this kind of love to other people. The world could always use a little more love, don’t you think? Love without fear. “There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.??1 John 4:18 If we let fear be a boundary, then we’ll never be able to give ourselves fully to others. Love can oftentimes come with pain, sadness, and regret, but if we focus on the “what ifs?then fear will always consume us. Love selflessly. “Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.??John 15:13 Selflessness is a learned trait. Our natural instinct is to put ourselves first, but it takes a conscious effort to care for the needs of others before our own. When we love without the thought of getting something in return, people take notice. It’s a quality that people forget about, but it multiplies beyond measure. Love your enemies. “’But to you who are listening I say: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you…’??Luke 6:27 Real strength comes from loving those who are hard to love. It’s easy to show love and kindness to your friends or family, but when’s the last time you extended it to someone that has done wrong to you in the past? Love through forgiveness. “Hatred stirs up conflict, but love covers all wrongs.??Proverbs 10:12 Forgiveness is a hard concept. How do we forgive someone who maybe doesn’t deserve it? It’s hard to show forgiveness and mercy in times that we least want to, but we have to remember who God is and what he’s done for us. His grace and mercy covers all our sins when we especially don’t deserve it, so we should have the same mindset toward others! Love sincerely. “Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good. Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves.??Romans 12:9-10 It’s important to be real, open, honest, and genuine toward others. This builds trust between two people and makes a relationship that much stronger. Learn to love others with a genuine heart, and people will feel the love of God through you! Make a conscious effort of loving people just as the way God loves us. Once again, the world could always use a little more love! ?Chelsea

It is the fear of getting too attached to something that one could no longer live or function without the other. These two pieces of wood were fine at the beginning. However, once they got significantly attached to the other like the model I did, if they ever got detached, they will both be left broken and functionless. This piece was inspired by the concept of my tape “drawing?from the last rotation, where I also portrayed my homesickness, a type of attachment, as an undesirable feelings.

67985	Fear	67985.jpg	The soul is not divorced from the body–it is immersed in all the muddy, pulpiness of the world, thank God. Whatever human things we do, whether it is growing, consuming, desiring, reasoning, or even just existing, we only exercise these things within the fond embrace of a body. That root-like mass of veins and digits is not a prison; it is potential. So if you choose to reach out blindly for the contours of your self, don’t be delusional—your body is more familiar with it than you will ever be. When it presents you with lust, fear, anxiety or euphoria, don’t misinterpret the gesture! Those delicately formed goose bumps are the most precious and intimate gift you will ever receive: Your very own skin, shyly offering clues in braille.	
67989	Fear	67989.jpg	It’s been about 3 weeks since Trump was elected president of the US. For many people, including myself, it has been a period of agony, anxiety, denial, and fear of what will happen next. In essence, not much of substance has happened since the election. No policies have been formalized or enacted. But every day now, there seems to be an unending stream of stories to keep you in suspense until his inauguration in January. You can read in any major international newspaper about Trump’s new cabinet member of the week, questions about the proposals he made during the campaign, or if he’s still going to wear that red hat. During this suspense, we’re told by many of our officials—locally, nationally, and internationally—to give him a chance. An open mind. But do successfully do that, anyone who took offense at what he said during the campaign would have to ignore or accept his remarks. To the groups he offended, he never apologized. If you offend someone and want to make amends, the fundamental thing you can do to move things forward is apologize. At the root of many of my concerns for the future around this is how self-serving, destructive behavior towards others is being legitimized in a leadership role—and one of the highest ones in the world at that. Schools around the world teach children to work together, help one another, and not be a bully to others. What does it say when people are willing to forgive basic values like those, especially if it could mean hurting others? What are your values? I always think about my values, and how they’re constantly being tested with the world changing around me. One of them is: I don’t believe we’re better on our own. I’ve seen beautiful things happen that are made possible by people working together who are of different ages and cultures. I’ve wanted to be a part of that. So over the last few years, I’ve tried hard to get more involved in my community, by volunteering much of my free time to organizations and groups that bring people together. Once I started volunteering more, I became more invested in my community and myself. Doing more work that benefitted others in a positive way made me think hard about what I was doing personally, and why I was doing it. How did I figure out what I wanted to get involved in? It just involved paper and a pen. Every once in awhile, I sit down and write out my values. These can be seemingly obvious things, like “I want to make people feel happy?or “I want to be close to my family.?You can put it on a piece of paper, a bunch of post-its, or your phone. Just make it something you can refer back to easily. When I write out my values like this, it helps me visualize the things in my life around those values. If I’m taking on a life change or big decision, I like to check it with my list—and see if it aligns or not. Sometimes those values need to change, and that’s ok. But at least I have a starting point, and I can revise from there. We have a lot of work to do when it comes to overcoming negative values, and it’s not just Americans. Now more than ever, it will take every ounce of strength we have in ourselves and our communities to fight the feelings of fear, division, and cruelty. One of the best places to start with fighting is to solidify the positive values within yourself. Then you can start helping others—especially people that are closest to you. And when you’re comfortable enough, you can reach out to your community like I have. The more people that can support your positive values outside of yourself, the better you’ll be able to support them in return. ?Matt

68081	Fear	68081.jpg	Befriending Inner Fear (Ajahn Brahm) Here are some listener’s notes on a dhamma talk last night by Ajahn Brahm on “Befriending Inner Fear? It could perhaps be summarised as a talk on right view and framing our experience in such a way that we shine and benefit others most. 1. Three Questions: When? Who? What? There are three important questions: 1) When is the most important time? 2) Who is the most important person? 3) What is the most important thing to do? I will answer these three questions. The most important time is “now? The most important person is “the one right in front of you? And the most important thing to do we will come to later, but it is not to do things at all, but “to take care of things? Stop choosing what to be aware of ?what is in front of you right now is the most important, so take care of it, don’t try to brush it aside or get rid of it. With this in mind, let’s meditate for ten minutes. [The moment he falls silent, a toddler bursts out crying and keeps crying and cries continuously.] This is a good practice! Don’t tell it to be quiet. Care for it. [But the parents are too embarrassed so after repeated shushing without success the frustrated father carries the child out of the lecture hall for a while until she calms down.] 2. Positive Framing: The Wisdom of the Great British Philosopher It’s supposed to be the most fearful thing you can do to give public talks. When I first started, I thought there would be only two outcomes. Either people would walk out, it would be terrible, I couldn’t connect with them, which would be great because I could sit back and be a hermit and take it easy. Or if they liked my talks and came in great numbers, then I could inspire people and give them happiness which would be marvelous! Either way, I didn’t need to worry. The best way to overcome your fear is to look at the world with a positive outlook! It reminds me of a lesson by the great British philosopher whom I’m sure you’ve heard of. His name is Winnie the Pooh, or Pooh Bear! When Little Piglet and Winnie the Pooh were walking through the forest through a raging storm, first twigs, then branches and then whole trees started falling?Piglet worried that a tree might fall whilst they were underneath it? To which Winnie the Pooh replied, “Supposing it didn’t??What if it fell where we weren’t underneath it? Fear is “what if…?followed by something negative. Replace it with something positive. A woman who had recovered from cancer worried, “What if my cancer came back??The fear was crippling her and no-one was able to help her. She asked me and my answer was, “What if it doesn’t??She got it straight away and it didn’t come back. Fear actually makes what we fear more likely because of the stress it causes. Like the TV show I saw when little about the grasshopper crossing a plank over a pool of acid, who gets nervous and falls only to discover it is just water: it is just the fear which pushes him in! So how to overcome fear so it doesn’t “push us in? It isn’t by overcoming, but by befriending it, embracing it, caring for it, allowing it to be without trying to get rid of it. 3. Let Go of Being Right & Share Getting your Way For those of you in relationships, something you will discover sooner or later is never try to convince your significant other that they are wrong. However good at debating you are, even if you are a successful lawyer with great skills at persuading juries, with your partner it’s different. I have a solution for this: simply check the calendar! If it’s an odd-numbered day, then the woman is right, if an even-numbered day the man is right. The observant amongst you will notice there are more odd-numbered days than even-numbered days in a year, but give the women that. As well as not trying to convince, don’t try to change. If you take care of each other, the change often happens naturally. 4. Stop Worrying What Others Think of You (they are thinking mostly of themselves) For those of you not in relationships, there’s something worth knowing which I wish I had been taught when young. It’s to stop worrying about how others think of us and to stop trying to put on some kind of act for them. What both men and women want in a partner is someone clean, trustworthy, kind, and happy. We spend our youth worrying what others are thinking of us. We do not realise others are worrying about themselves and not thinking about us at all. Let go of the fear of what others might be thinking. This self-confidence also turns out to be attractive. Maybe if I’d known that when I was younger, I wouldn’t have become a monk. But I’m very happy being a monk. 5. Stop Putting Off Happiness: When you are happy, that is success! We spend our lives putting off happiness. “If only ? then I’ll be happy?First, it’s succeeding at exams, then finding a job, a partner, a house, a car?but the happiness never comes but keeps getting pushed back. Finally, it is looking forward to retirement, or for some people even death and the paradise to come. But happiness doesn’t come from success. Psychologists turn this around and say that success comes from happiness. The truth is different however. When you are happy, that is success! 6. You are Beautiful Because of your Imperfections “I am enough?as I saw once on a T-shirt. I love T-shirts because they are full of wisdom. Another I saw once said on the first line: “Nobody is perfect.?Then below that: “I am nobody. Therefore, I am perfect.?If you go to a wood, there is no such thing as a perfectly formed tree. Every tree is crooked and has damaged leaves and broken branches. In fact, your favourite tree is probably the most bent and crooked. Broken branches are where birds nest. There is beauty in all your faults and perfection in all your failings. When we do things, we tend to be downhearted by our mistakes and focus attention on them, but like the wall with two crooked bricks, look at them instead as a “feature? 7. Hearting the Shadow Self: A Practice There are parts of ourselves for which our fear is too great to connect with and befriend intellectually. And so, I recommend this practice. Imagine the doorway of your heart, a big Valentine heart, opening and a staircase descending from the part of you which you love and accept to those parts of yourself that are excluded or that are full of fear, the child in you who feels rejected or hurt. And lovingly invite these excluded parts and memories up the staircase into your heart to comfort and accept them, saying “you are part of me? Embrace them. Embrace your shadow side. The catharsis that comes from this process is incredible. To Summarise: 1) stay present and aware and take care of whatever is before you now, 2) put attention on positive aspects of experiences and people, 3) do not try to convince, push aside, change or cure or failure will be disheartening, but instead focus on doing your best to care for people, 4) be trustworthy and kind, but also be confident not fearing what others think of you, 5) success is happiness now, 6) there is beauty in all your faults and perfection in all your failings, and 7) open the door of your heart to welcome in and fully accept your shadow selves and so realise your beautiful and perfect wholeness, not just intellectually but from your heart.

To get an idea of how widespread the phenomenon of allowing superstitions to control our behavior is in America, let’s look at some numbers. According to the clinical director of the Anxiety Treatment Center in Chicago, Karen Cassiday, about 10.5 million people in the U.S. suffer from obsessive-compulsive behavior, and a quarter of those harbor strong superstitious phobias. Beyond that, an additional 21 million have generalized anxiety disorder, up to 80 percent of whom are superstitious, Cassiday estimates. Now, take that many people whose fear and worry control their every move, and it’s bound to have a nationwide effect. A single Friday the 13th in America is estimated to cost the economy as much as $900 million, because instead of going on vacations, going to work, shopping, and doing everything else otherwise known as “being human,?all those people are instead sitting at home stewing in puddles of their own terror pee. 5 Harmless Superstitions With Horrifying Global Consequences

69026	Fear	69026.jpg	People will subject themselves to immense fear to gain social status, says researcher October 29, 2015 by Darrah Tinkler, Kansas State University For many, Halloween is a night filled with treats, costumes, ghosts, ghouls and some fear—which can be a good thing, according to a Kansas State University expert. Don Saucier, associate professor of psychological sciences in the university’s College of Arts & Sciences, says that there is evolutionary value in fear. “Fear is adaptive,?Saucier said. “Fear keeps us safe. We are afraid of heights because we know we can fall, and we are afraid of the dark because it holds the unknown.? But if fear is an evolutionary aspect to survive, then why do people enjoy feeling fear on Halloween? Saucier says that society enjoys embracing the spirit of the holidays. Being scared on Halloween is culturally embedded, such as giving is embedded in the Christmas holiday. Fear also causes arousal for those being scared. People’s hands may shake, their heart may beat faster and they may begin to sweat. Partaking in being scared on a holiday like Halloween then makes this arousal nonthreatening; feeling fear becomes fun, Saucier said. So, if feeling fear becomes fun in a nonthreatening atmosphere around Halloween, then why are people willing to visit those mega-haunted houses where they have to sign a waiver to even enter? “There is a social aspect to haunted houses,?Saucier said. “Halloween becomes a competition where people subject themselves to immense fear to gain social status. They try to become a ‘survivor.’? Haunted houses are a culturally related activity associated with a popular holiday and they provide the opportunity for people to gain social status by engaging in it, Saucier said. The activity of visiting and surviving haunted houses becomes an experience that is, most of the time, shared with friends. “Some researchers argue that happiness comes from experiences,?Saucier said. “These experiences are more pronounced when shared with friends, and most people who go through haunted houses, go as groups.? The experience of fear creates a social connection, he said. When people are scared, they look for support and consolation. When people subject themselves to feeling fear in haunted houses with their friends, they create a lasting experience that gives them a reason to be together. Source:

70078	Fear	70078.jpg	Oxytocin helps to better overcome fear Frightening experiences do not quickly fade from memory. A team of researchers under the guidance of the University of Bonn Hospital has now been able to demonstrate in a study that the bonding hormone oxytocin inhibits the fear center in the brain and allows fear stimuli to subside more easily. This basic research could also usher in a new era in the treatment of anxiety disorders. The study has already appeared in advance online in the journal “Biological Psychiatry? The print edition will be available in a few weeks. Significant fear becomes deeply entrenched in memory. Following a car accident, for example, it is difficult to manage street traffic once again - even screeching tires can evoke significant anxiety. Scientists refer to this as “conditioning? Certain images or noises are very closely intertwined in the brain with the experience of pain or fear. Only gradually does one learn that not every screeching tire means danger. This active overwriting in the memory is known as “extinction? “In this process, however, the original contents of the memory are not erased but instead merely overlaid with positive experiences,?explains Prof. Dr. Dr. René Hurlemann from the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the University of Bonn Hospital. If there are dangerous situations once again, the fear, which was believed to have been already overcome, frequently flares up once more. Extinction is often used in therapy for anxiety disorders. For example, a person suffering from a spider phobia will gradually and increasingly come face to face with spiders. First the patient has to view photos of spiders and then look at living examples until finally he holds a tarantula in his hand. When people with an anxiety disorder experience as frequently as possible the fact that they do not need to fear the trigger, their fear is reduced. “However, this can take a very long time, because this confrontation with the fearful situation frequently has to be experienced. In addition, there may be relapses because the original trace of fear is still anchored in the memory,?reports Prof. Hurlemann. This is why therapists seek a possibility for “overwriting?the fearful memory in a faster and longer-lasting way. Oxytocin facilitates overwriting of fearful experiences It has been known for a long time that the hormone oxytocin does not just have a bonding effect in the mother-child relationship and in the case of sex partners but that it is also considered to be anxiolytic. The scientists at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the University of Bonn, together with their colleagues from the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg and the University of Chengdu (China) have now been able to prove its helpful effect in overwriting fearful experiences. “Oxytocin actually reinforces extinction: Under its influence, the expectation of recurrent fear subsequently abates to a greater extent than without this messenger,?says study director Prof. Hurlemann, summarizing the result. The team of scientists induced fear conditioning in a total of 62 healthy male subjects. In the brain scanner, using video glasses, the test subjects viewed photos, for example of human faces. For 70 percent of the images, they received a very brief, unpleasant electrical shock to the hand via electrodes. “In this way, certain images were associated with an experience of anxiety in the test subjects?memory,?explains Prof. Hurlemann. The scientists used two methods to prove that this pairing of a particular photo and pain was actually anchored in the test subjects?brains: The expectation of an electrical shock was demonstrated by increased cold sweat which was measured via skin conductivity. In addition, the brain scans prove that the fear regions in the brain were always particularly active. Half of the test subjects received oxytocin via a nasal spray. The rest received a placebo. Then the extinction phase began in which the test persons were shown the same pictures several times as before but they no longer received electrical shocks. In the men under the influence of oxytocin, the amygdala, as the fear center in the brain, was overall far less active than in the control group, whereas fear-inhibiting regions were more stimulated. Over time, the messenger caused the fear to initially be somewhat greater but then it abated to a far greater extent than without oxytocin. The scientists explain this through the special effect of the messenger: “Oxytocin initially reinforces the test subjects?conscious impressions and thus the reaction to the electrical shock, yet after a few minutes, the anxiolytic effect prevails,?explains Prof. Hurlemann. The scientists hope that anxiety patients can be helped more quickly with the aid of oxytocin and that a relapse can be better prevented. In addition, the researchers presume that the hormone likely facilitates bonding between the therapist and the patient and thus the success of the treatment. “However, this must first be demonstrated by clinical studies,?says the scientist from the University of Bonn Hospital.

Stepping away from those who love you is clearly a move stemmed from your stubbornness to not see anything but what’s inside your head. Read Full Article

71106	Fear	71106.jpg	Next time you are participating in a debate or watching one, look out for logical fallacies such as this: appeal to emotion You attempted to manipulate an emotional response in place of a valid or compelling argument. Appeals to emotion include appeals to fear, envy, hatred, pity, pride, and more. It’s important to note that sometimes a logically coherent argument may inspire emotion or have an emotional aspect, but the problem and fallacy occurs when emotion is used instead of a logical argument, or to obscure the fact that no compelling rational reason exists for one’s position. Everyone, bar sociopaths, is affected by emotion, and so appeals to emotion are a very common and effective argument tactic, but they’re ultimately flawed, dishonest, and tend to make one’s opponents justifiably emotional. Example: Luke didn’t want to eat his sheep’s brains with chopped liver and brussel sprouts, but his father told him to think about the poor, starving children in a third world country who weren’t fortunate enough to have any food at all.

71612	Fear	71612.jpg	Una mia cara amica si é iscritta a Tumblr. Niente di così preoccupante a dire il vero. Il problema é che mi ha chiesto come mi chiamassi per poter seguire il mio blog. Ma io non voglio. Non voglio sentirmi obbligata a scrivere solo determinate cose, non voglio non poter pubblicare le frasi o le foto che voglio. Ho paura che mi scambi per una depressa e che la sua opinione su di me possa cambiare. Non voglio che la gente pensi che sono depressa, che mi taglio, che sono anoressica, bulimica o che abbia altri problemi del genere. Io, infatti, pubblico queste cose solo per portare avanti una “battaglia personale?che ho involontariamente intrapreso in questi giorni: liberare e cambiare questa schifosa società fatta di giudizi, pettegolezzi, insulti, dicerie, e, allo stesso tempo, provare a liberarmi di quel che dice la gente e della sgradevolissima sensazione che mi impedisce di fare quello che vorrei veramente, che mi impedisce di essere me stessa solo per paura di quello che pensano gli altri. Comprendo perfettamente, perció, chi si taglia o chi arriva a odiare profondamente il proprio corpo e la propria anima per colpa delle dicerie altrui; capisco la sensazione di libertà che si puó provare per compiere simili gesti e non riesco ad immaginare il livello di malessere interiore che porta una persona a vedere nel suicidio la sua unica salvezza, che ha questo grandissimo desiderio di porre fine alla sua vita, e così facendo a tutte le sofferenze, tanto da infondergli un grandissimo coraggio, che io ora non riuscirei a trovare, per tagliarsi e suicidarsi. Ma io ripeto, non ho mai provato nulla di simile. Solo una volta ho provato a indurmi il vomito ma il mio tentativo é stato inutile e da quel giorno non ho piú provato per paura di cadere in un'associazione pitale senza fine, in un buco troppo profondo dal quale non riuscirei piú a uscire. Da un lato però, odio e non riesco a capire che si taglia solo per moda, perché ormai lo fanno tutti. Perché fa molto ragazza tosta, forte e debole allo stesso tempo andare in giro con cerotti chiazzati di sangue come per voler far vedere a che livello di sofferenza si é arrivati. Tra i ragazzi di oggi, infatti, é tutta un gara su chi soffre di piú. Ma quelli che offrono realmente non sono quelli che lo fanno sapere a tutti, che pubblicano su social network le foto del loro apparente malessere, oppure quelli che si fanno vedere con i cerotti uno polsi. Le persone che soffrono veramente sono quelle che si tengono tutto entro, che si tagliano in posti nascosti per non far vedere il risultato della loro sofferenza a nessuno, quelli che sono sempre sorridenti e positivi con gli amici e cercano sempre di sorridere anche se molte volte vorrebbero semplicemente urlare e sfogarsi con qualcuno. Io mi riconosco maggiormente in quest'ultima descrizione.

The link between the hips and emotional energy is remarkable. Many energy healers and practitioners believe the front of the hips are our fear of the future, the back of hips our fear of letting go of the past. This is the location of Svadisthana Chakra, our pleasure, procreation and sexual energy center and where our romantic relationships evolve or dissolve. …? I believe with my entire heart and soul in the science of energy and the fact that what we vibrate and send out emanates back into our lives. We all have things we’d like to release, but why do we grasp so hard? Imagine what it would feel like to let go and open. 🤔 …?

71837	Fear	71837.jpg	FINDING RESPITE IN FALSEHOOD Jerome Yaovi Onipede *All Rights Reserved Everytime we find ourselves stretched out by the situations of life, when we come under enormous pressure, there is a possibility that we give in into finding pleasure, satisfaction and happiness in a lie, despite the fact that we know from the beginning that that is exactly what it is, A LIE! What happens if we stay longer in this untrue state? The lie starts to become our own fabricated truth which we eventually resign to live by, and it’s always sweet at the beginning, because it always starts with false relief, then the bitterness sets in, because it has no power to set free, and anything that cannot set us free will only make our lives more miserable. What can be the reason for this? Well, the Truth that we know may be becoming unbearable. Unbearable, because Truth does not bend, but rather bends us to shape. Truth does not change based on how we feel, but helps our feelings to realign with our purpose in life. Truth does not bring its fruits into manifestation based on our timing, but His, because while our attention is always focused on only an aspect of our lives at different times, the attention of Truth is focused on the totality of all that we are, and so when things are not working for us as we planned, we start becoming impatient, restless, ungrateful and ungovernable not realising the fact that TRUTH MAKES ALL THINGS THAT PERTAINS TO OUR LIVES TO WORK TOGETHER FOR GOOD, and not just an aspect of our lives. May I encourage you to read Psalm 24, and you will find out how becoming resilient in working with Truth will make the Almighty God rise on your behalf to open every shut gate against you so His Blessings can work in your life for the world to see. I pray we will no longer be toys in the hands of our enemies to play with, but a threshing instrument in the hands of God to bring about His Purpose on Earth. Amen.

72194	Fear	72194.jpg	Why Abused Kids Are More Likely To Develop Anxiety And Depression? Maltreatment during childhood can lead to long-term changes in brain circuits that process fear, researchers say. This could help explain why children who suffer abuse are much more likely than others to develop problems like anxiety and depression later on. Brain scans of teenagers revealed weaker connections between the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus in both boys and girls who had been maltreated as children, a team from the University of Wisconsin reports in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Girls who had been maltreated also had relatively weak connections between the prefrontal cortex the amygdala. Those weaker connections “actually mediated or led to the development of anxiety and depressive symptoms by late adolescence,?says Ryan Herringa, a psychiatrist at the University of Wisconsin and one of the study’s authors. Maltreatment can be physical or emotional, and it ranges from mild to severe. So the researchers asked a group of 64 fairly typical 18-year-olds to answer a questionnaire designed to assess childhood trauma. The teens are part of a larger study of more than 500 families that has been tracking children’s social and emotional development since 1994. The participants were asked how strongly they agreed or disagreed with statements like, “When I was growing up I didn’t have enough to eat,?or “my parents were too drunk or high to take care of the family,?or “somebody in my family hit me so hard that it left me with bruises or marks.? There were also statements about emotional and sexual abuse. The responses indicated that some had been maltreated in childhood while others hadn’t. All of the participants had their brains scanned using a special type of MRI to measure the strength of connections among three areas of the brain involved in processing fear. One area is the prefrontal cortex, which orchestrates our thoughts and actions, Herringa says. Another is the amygdala, which is “the brain’s emotion and fear center,?he says, and triggers the “fight or flight?response when we encounter something scary.The participants were asked how strongly they agreed or disagreed with statements like, “When I was growing up I didn’t have enough to eat,?or “my parents were too drunk or high to take care of the family,?or “somebody in my family hit me so hard that it left me with bruises or marks.?

72562	Fear	72562.jpg	Fear (2013) Light pollution is a huge issue facing astronomers in this day and age, as well as having an impact on the environment and delicate ecosystems. I decided to base my last IB piece on this message, to turn off our lights and look to the stars instead of being blind to them. I was inspired by a poem by Sarah Williams which included the phrase “I have loved the stars too fondly, to be fearful of the night." The main idea was to have a flashing bulb that would be on and make the stars harder to distinguish and then turn off to make the stars far clearer. The stars create the phrase from the poem. I was inspired by Su Blackwell when it came to the bulb, I used an atlas to represent the world and how this is a global issue, creating trees from the pages. The trees are clustered around the bulb, the shadows cast when the bulb is lit adding more interest. There is a more powerful, energy saving bulb behind the thick, heavy black curtain fabric I used for the night sky. This is by far one of my favorite pieces! I just wish I could have it up all the time, its hard to when it’s more of an installation. Some close-ups to come!

72907	Fear	72907.jpg	I didn’t eat eggs for about 30 years. It was difficult/impossible to eat them. I didn’t just dislike them, I hated them more than any food in the world. I was opposed to eggs. But recovery has involved doing lots of things that I thought I didn’t like, and doing them has been incredibly beneficial. So I began looking at other things that I thought I didn’t like, that didn’t seem like they were my kind of thing, things I thought I couldn’t do. I’ve learned that most of those things are just driven by fears and anxieties, even if I’ve forgotten what the original fear was by now. I’ve been learning how to add those things into my life if I know they would be beneficial to my health. One of those things is eating eggs. My aversion to eggs probably came from emetophobia (fear of vomit) connected to the other OCD symptoms I struggled with. The smell of eggs made my skin crawl. The texture made me gag because I associated it with vomit. I believed that deviled eggs truly were the devil. If I was a guest at somebody’s house and they served eggs, I’d politely eat them as long as I could drown then in ketchup, hot sauce, and pepper. And then I’d need to go someplace to calm myself down afterwards. Eggs caused me stress. So I decided to bring eggs into my life. Being stressed out by eggs wasn’t helping me with anything. And I was missing out on a convenient, high-protein breakfast food. Cutting out an avoidance compulsion works the same as cutting out any compulsion: you expose yourself to the thing you’re compulsively avoiding, and when your brain says, “Ahhhh! Get away!!!?you smile and you don’t run away. So I ate eggs! I lived eggs! I pretended I liked them no matter what my brain said. I made eggs every morning for weeks. I sat up straight and smiled while I shovelled them down. My brain screamed at me that they were disgusting, and I didn’t argue with it, but I kept on eating and smiling. Brains don’t like to waste energy, so our brains won’t keep freaking out about something if we stop reacting it. This works for cutting out typical anxious compulsions, and it works for introducing things we find difficult. Now I eat eggs almost every morning. But a couple of months ago, I would have said that making eggs (or even having eggs in my fridge) was impossible for me. I’ll share my egg bacon muffin recipe next week. - Mark

Imagine if for the next twenty-four hours you had to wear a cap that amplified your thoughts so that everyone within a hundred yards of you could hear every thought that passed through your head. Imagine if the mind were broadcast so that all about you could overhear your thoughts and fantasies, your dreams and fears. How embarrassed or fearful would you be to go outside? How long would you let your fear of the mind continue to isolate you from the hearts of others? And though this experiment sounds like one which few might care to participate in, imagine how freeing it would be at last to have nothing to hide. And how miraculous it would be to see that all others?minds too were filled with the same confusion and fantasies, the same insecurity and doubt. How long would it take the judgmental mind to begin to release its grasp, to see through the illusion of separateness, to recognize with some humor the craziness of all beings?minds, the craziness of mind itself?? “But I think it is very useful, and indeed more accurate, to call it “the mind?instead of “my mind.? - Stephen Levine View Post

I used to know the answers to every question people asked me. But now, for some reason, I get lost more and more often, trying to figure out a resolution for another friend. Maybe, when we grow up, the questions we ask don’t have answers? Because all of them are so complex, and not even due to life problems, but due to problems in our brain. We make everything more complicated than it really is. I used to not believe that drinking helps people talk to others, relax, do whatever they want. Now with every following day I believe more and more in this theory. I am disappointed with myself. I am growing up. I am becoming blind.

73781	Fear	73781.jpg	It’s one thing to say that you are going to better yourself, improve your skills and achieve a better lifestyle for yourself, but it’s another thing to take action and then continue taking action. Personal Development is a lifetime journey and one that offers so much satisfaction & reward. I was always someone that wanted success and to have a happier lifestyle, but as much as I wanted it, I never really maintained my focus and instead, just expected it to come to me. I am so grateful to have been introduced to Personal Development, with the capabilities & potential it provides, but also, it is now become my career. In just one year, it has turned my life around, on what has been an amazing and enjoyable ride, to which my lifestyle has improved out of sight. Some of the examples of Personal Development goals listed in this article, most people wouldn’t even consider these actions to be of any value to help them change their lives, but they sure do. There’s a few examples on this list I definitely still need to work on, but that’s the beauty of the journey. I get to improve myself on a daily basis, continue to enjoy a happy & healthy lifestyle and help others, to achieve the same, in the process. Don’t underestimate the value of Personal Development.

74770	Fear	74770.jpg	✨Peace to worried hearts and minds in Jesus Name. There is a time and a season to everything under the sun [Ecclesiastes 3]. Should we really have the audacity to question what God speaks? He is the Alpha, the Omega, the Beginning and the End. ? His Word does not return void. And if Jesus Christ is the WORD made flesh, and the Word says that He is the same yesterday, today and forever + the Bible is God-BREATHED >> then you cannot fail with what God has spoken over your life. ? It doesn’t matter how long it takes?stop grappling. It doesn’t matter what people say || God is on the Throne. What He has for you can’t be retracted by human hands. ? Rest IN God. He is for you. He loves you! And He knows you even when you feel scatter brained and don’t think you know who you are. That’s when you take EVERY thought into subjection and make it obedient to Christ himself. The lies you’re believing have no breathing room for where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. And there is peace. Rest in Almighty Yahweh. Help us coming. Right on time. 🙏🏻?

74849	Fear	74849.jpg	Fibro?Fear? Frustration! When you live with chronic illness there is always fear. There is fear that you’ll get worse, fear that you’ll be in such terrible pain forever, fear that you won’t be able to do this or that, there is always fear associated with a chronic illness. It is a fear that is difficult to explain to someone who hasn’t experienced a similar illness but it is very real. It is so easy for it to be so much more than this though. New pains bring new concerns. Symptoms that we cannot explain or have not had in the past make us wonder what more we might have to endure. And then when our doctor or doctors can’t find an answer for us that makes sense our fear often turns to panic and frustration. Read the whole article here

75947	Fear	75947.jpg	“If your life is based upon wishful thinking and hope alone, you will choose those voices that tell you what you wish to hear and that amplify and justify your hope. If your approach to life is based on fear, you will listen to those voices that tell you that you have no power in the universe and that it is useless to resist. These are two forms of persuasion leading to the same end. But the path of freedom for humanity has to set a higher goal and one more difficult to achieve. For acquiescence is easy. Submission appears to be easy. Receiving gifts, and with them governance, appears to be easy. Many people want what is easy, even if it is not what is right.?

76368	Fear	76368.jpg	11th Feb 2019. Fear, anxiety and worry are absolutely suffocating to the point where you start thinking irrationally; I once saw “worrying is like praying for something bad to happen? Often the scenario we create in our heads is worse than the actual thing we’re worried about and once it happens you usually look back and laugh, right? I used to suffer with a lot of anxiety, stress and worry and now that I have broken free, I can confidently say it was all God. Psalm 56 says “when I am afraid, I put my trust in you? as a living testimony of what trusting God does for your life, I wholeheartedly encourage you to do so. Each step you take to move forward in your faith comes with the momentum you need to break out of this fear. God will never call you to do something that He would never empower or equip you to do; God is calling you out of your fear and you may not believe you’re capable, but He has equipped you with that ability. Naturally, we are overthinkers and there is nothing worse than overthinking yourself into a flurry of what ifs. Reading this you may be thinking what will happen if I put my trust in God? Today I read something that woke me up even more, what will happen if you play it safe and by your will, not God’s? To answer that: when you live bold you invite God’s blessings into your life, but when you don’t, you don’t. Being bold in your faith doesn’t mean you don’t have fear though, it just means your faith is MUCH bigger. So let me leave you with this: “When you move forward in the power of Christ, you will be unstoppable? who wouldn’t want to be unstoppable? P.S Today’s the penultimate day of the 7 day devotional I have been reading on the Bible app “Take a hold of the faith you long for?by Sharon Jaynes and I have really been blessed by it.

76385	Fear	76385.jpg	Last night the motion detector light came on outside. I don’t know why - I’m totally alone til the end of the week. I laid in my bed until it turned off, wondering why it was on for so long. I didn’t sleep just in case something opened the door downstairs. Just in case. Turns out sitting there in terror does bad things when you go back to sleep. I had a dream where the light outside my room turned off and I had to use my phone’s screen to navigate. When I shone it around to orient myself I found a little black cat sitting there, but it wasn’t mine. It was a terrible looking little beast that looked almost horridly cartoonish next to the fairly realistic scenery of the dream. I was drawn to it though, and I left my bed to call it to me, but it ran off. I chased after it and it looked at me from on top of the couch and let out this deep, chest-resonating “Mow.? I woke up with a deep-seated feeling of dread and fear. My throat felt tight and my whole body felt ready to bolt. I didn’t go to sleep til 6am.

76526	Fear	76526.jpg	I am supposed to tell you to stay strong, brave faced, and all will be okay. But the reality is we all get opportunity to worry and try to work things out in our own strength. The truth is we must fight each battle in Gods strength. This is me exhausted, trying to fit everything in and leaning on my own strength when I should have been turning it all over to God. Like me you may be facing many giants, maybe stripped to your last doller on your pocket, lonely and fearful, but that is when you come to God depleted, empty, ready to be poured in to the overflow. When we are humble and empty, God lifts us up. You have already won the battle for He has given you victory over the Goliaths. (at Melbourne, Victoria, Australia)	
76558	Fear	76558.jpg	The term “Leap of faith?is very descriptive. There are times in life when we have to leap into the unknown and trust that we can fly. When a hang glider leaps from the side of a mountain, the first thing that happens is that it falls. Then the wind catches the wing and the hang glider comes back up to fly on the currents of air. This is how it works. There is a period of free fall in every leap of faith when we feel like we aren’t going to make it, but when the faith is there, we know the wind will catch our wings and we come back up to greater heights than where we were before. However, the person with the hang glider doesn’t just go leap off a mountain. He develops the knowledge of how to use a hang glider, and has the gear he needs to do what he is planning to do first. He checks that gear for safety before ever taking the plunge, and does his part in the process. The Arabs have a saying, “Trust Allah, but tie your camel.?This means, have faith, but do your part. When we are planning a leap of faith, we need to do our part. This may mean research, planning, and preparation. When we know we have done our part, then we can do what we need to do, and trust that God, life, the universe will do the rest. Our research may not show us what to expect, and there may be surprises. Our plans can be sidelined, and our preparations insufficient, but we still need to have faith that we will figure things out, we will find our way and make it work, and if we have to fly by the seat of our pants for a while, so be it. Faith is not trying. Faith is knowing that even if things don’t work out exactly the way we wanted and expected, we are still going to be okay and we are going to reach the heights we wanted to reach. You might as well go for it, because?what else are you going to do? If you are going to leap, leap with faith and courage. Courage is not something we either have or we don’t have. It is the choice we make when we stop listening to fear. karlyletomms.com

Sebenarnya di dalam Islam, langit bisa bermakna “surga?sehingga adalah benar ini merupakan cita-cita tertinggi dan menimbulkan rasa takut, apakah kita telah bekerja keras yang terbaik untuk memperoleh rahmat Allah memasuki surga-Nya. Karena Allah telah berjanji, “Wahai manusia! Sesungguhnya kamu telah bekerja keras menuju Tuhanmu, maka kamu akan menemui-Nya [di surga].?(QS. Al-Insyiqaq: 6). Sayang kebanyakan manusia teralihkan dari cita-cita ini.

At these times it can be scary and disorienting but have faith that when the fog lifts there will be the most beautiful clear path lit by the Sun.

77161	Fear	77161.jpg	STEPHEN KING THE MAVERICK RAPSCALLION Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU Editions La Dondaine ?Amazon Kindle Store When passionate ardent zealous readers have spent fifty years with Stephen King and his books, his videos, his films, his comic strips, either they become berserk or they become truth diggers, fear miners, horror finders-keepers, like the three chaps in the tub, the butcher, the baker, the candlestick-maker, all of them with truth, fear and horror as the three maids, all rub-a-dub-dubbing with energy and intensity one another and each other and even themselves with rags, brushes and other hairy cilices. Stephen King makes them obsessive-compulsive like most traumatized people surviving with PTSS. But their enjoyment is greater than anything you may imagine, and their pleasure can be cut up and minced with the butcher’s cleaver, and then wrapped up in the dough of a meatloaf before being pushed into the oven of the baker, and it all ends up with a candle-stick burning from both ends and being rub-a-dub-dubbed by the feverish shivering shuddering hands of the addicted mortified reader. You will find in this maze of reviews and studies references to practically half the books and titles by Stephen King and half a dozen titles of books by his sons and a few other people, including a musical, and of course numerous films, series (mini or not) and videos. You have to enter the forest of these more than one hundred trees by assessing the table of contents and then letting you glide, slip and slide into the rich deep brewing witches?midnight banquet with the devil on a sacred Black Sabbath celebrating the immolation of Isaac by Isaac’s father, the kicking away to the desert of Ismail and his mother by Ismail’s father, the two fathers being the same man in some sacred books revered by more than half humanity. Accept your fate and enjoy it. Feel the knife of the executioner ripping your chest open and then his hand dipping into it and uprooting your heart out of your body. Feel your blood seeping out and curdling on the ground. You deserve that cathartic experience to simply survive your humdrum routine-like everyday life. This catharsis might liberate your imagination from all death wish and death instinct, but it may also neutralize all your desire to forgive, pardon and tolerate all your libidinal charitable and generous altruistic desires to be good. Let’s hope after that experience you will be able to step out of Stephen King’s universe and live up to the demands from society and regain some humane love for others. Be sure you will encounter in these books, videos, and films many monsters who will brutalize you in all possible ways, but be sure too it is your deeper desire to be brutalized by these monsters over and over again in the middle of the night.

77412	Fear	77412.jpg	Last night I was having a really really bad night. Fear and paranoia wrapped itself around me, squeezed and squeezed, I felt like I was suffocating inside of myself. This is how I’ve been feeling a lot lately. Like something inside of me is trying to swallow me alive and bury me, I dont feel like myself anymore. It’s a terrifying feeling, to be lost in your own body. To be unable to find a home within your own skin. But it’s a feeling I’ve known well for a very long time.. I am lucky, though. I don’t always have to be strong, I dont always have to push myself so hard (although I still do). I have my Papa, and He is my Hero. He let’s me cry, and scream, and ramble about things that dont even make sense. He picks me up off the floor and wipes away my tears. He holds me when I need to be held, He feeds me when I cant feed myself, He bathes me when I can’t muster the energy to even wash my own hair.. He is the best thing that ever happened to me. I drew this for Him last night while I was trying to calm down from a really bad panic attack.. by the time I was finished I was calm and collected. It reminded me that I’m not alone, Daddy will always be there to lift me up from my dark places. Daddy will always be there to guide me and love me. I am not alone, even if sometimes I feel lonely. I’m the luckiest little baby in the universe to have He makes everything all better, sometimes without even trying. I love You, Papa. 💕 (I’m a little rusty on my drawing skills, it’s been a few years since I’ve done any drawing.. But Papa still likes it!)

I struggle with my body and it’s faults; it’s broken pieces and loosened sutures, it’s physical failings and my own destructive attempts to control, to heal, to hide and not feel. I struggle with my mind and it’s blur; it’s jumbled words and incoherent thoughts, it’s unfocused stories and my own distractions to hide my incompetence, my doubt, my fear of failing. I’m afraid to hear what the stories will say. I’m not strong enough to understand what they need me to feel. I’ve broken myself again and again trying; and they tug at me to beg my attention, my love, my gaze, and whisper and hope that I will see their beauty. And how can I? Their pull pushes me off balance again and I spin, uncontrolled, into a storm of words I can never be prepared for. // with ・・? “All the stories I would like to write persecute me. When I am in my chamber, it seems as they are all around me, like little devils, and while one tugs at my ear, another tweaks my nose, and each says to me, "Sir, write me, I am beautiful.?

77513	Fear	77513.jpg	We are so use to being comfortable, it leaves little space for us to be uncomfortable. Now, I am referring to the growth of you?taking the leap of faith so to speak. There are so many dreams and aspirations that we have and what we want to achieve, but there is something which always stops us. Every time we get close to it, we get the feeling of doubt; what if and so on. This is our ego talking. Our ego wanting to stay in the box because it knows it is safe. But when we challenge the ego and we ride through the fear, the doubt we realise it wasn’t that bad. By doing so you just increased your comfort zone, you have just accepted fears challenge. You even taught your ego it’s okay to venture outside the box ? •••? (at London, United Kingdom)	
77518	Fear	77518.jpg	It felt like nonelastic bands tied to her heart, inside her chest—constricting the pulse—pulling up and out of her mouth. It was pulling more out of her, more than she knew she had. So much so, tears sprang to her eyes. Her face flushed. It was panic and fear and longing and love. More than anything, it terrified her. To the point that it was immobilizing. Like being stuck in a vacuum. No air, no noise; no one to notice. Completely silenced by fear. She couldn’t move. And he went on.

77581	Fear	77581.jpg	POSITIVE SIDE OF FEAR. We all must master our fear. We must overcome it. It is in our deepest fear that our ministries lie. The lessons we learn from what we have conquered is what makes us. It becomes a weapon on our hands and in our hearts. Moses first had to learn and master the art of holding a live untamed snake at the tail without killing it. Why did God turn his staff into a snake and not a dog? If moses was to face the enemy, he had to master his fear. Was Moses afraid of snakes? Our fear was not made to destroy us but to build us, make us brave. Our fear becomes our message. Remember that no man was born brave. We become brave because there is something to fear. -Paul Bamikole

77909	Fear	77909.jpg	Do you FEAR THE UNKNOWN? It is completely ok to be uncertain about what your future holds, but to fear it and block your ability to grow is not ok. See, you don’t need to fear the unknown because the unknown is known when you are in control of the life you desire to create. When you are someone who learns from your mistakes, has no regrets and understands that your intuition is guiding you every step of the way, then why fear it? We all have gut instincts and maybe even déjà vu, we have all that that moment where we said to ourselves ?I knew this was going to happen.?So here’s my advice, learn to take healthy risks to design the life you desire and shift your perspective that fear of the unknown can actually be anticipation of manifesting.

77961	Fear	77961.jpg	“I AM THE SUN.? Warmth. That’s how the dream starts. Always the same. There’s a blanket of warmth on my face and my eyes are closed, but I know it’s the distant, setting sun. I don’t open my eyes, not at first, but when I do, I see it. The ball of pure light hanging tiredly just above the horizon. I see the colors shatter across the sky in brush strokes of red and yellow and violet, all broken up by wispy clouds on their way to find a better place to rain on. The gleam becomes too much and I can’t keep looking into it, so I avert my eyes downward as my hands reach out and touch the grassy grains that stand all around me. It’s unlike any field I’ve ever seen, standing up to my waist and stretching almost all the way to the edge of the world. They’re interrupted by a lonely tree. Its close, only a moderate walk’s distance, but the edges of its silhouette shimmer like silver as the lazy sun’s light pours around it. I can’t take my eyes off it, nor can I suppress the need to go to it. I hesitate to take a step. Suddenly I am aware of myself, having been taken so entirely by my surroundings before. The grassy grains are tall and majestic, but the ground I walk on is soft and the field seems to part before me as I walk forward. I trail my hands out to my sides, brushing the whiskers extending from the grain stalks. They tickle my palms, and it feels nice. Everything about this place feels so nice and inviting. It feels like I’m home. I take my gaze back upward to meet the tree from before, the silver tree that I needed so badly to get to. Burning, fire, pain. A haze of red has befallen the landscape before me, and suddenly I feel so entirely and completely unwelcome. I have to get out, I have to leave. The tree is ablaze and the grains all around me have somehow rotted and gone flat to the ground. The sky is dark maroon and the ground is rough on my bare feet. I plant and turn to sprint back. Maybe, I think, if I go back, things will be beautiful again and I can just stay there, longing but unable to reach the silver tree. My leg snaps with the sudden turn. My feet seem to have been held steadfast by some unknown force, and with my turning motion the bones in my lower leg have twisted to their elastic limit and given way to the motion. I try to scream, but someone is already screaming for me. I can hear it echoing off of the vast, empty, rotten field. There is no one to hear me. There is no one to come help. There is just me, whimpering and crying. I crawl as far as I can, dragging feet that feel more like cinderblocks, one of which is loosely dancing around with every imperfection in the once tilled earth beneath me. Daggers shoot up my leg with every millimeter I move, but I push. I keep pushing, dragging myself with as much strength as my arms can muster, but I am becoming weak. Surely I have made progress. Surely I am closer to my salvation, to the beautiful place. I look around at my surroundings, but before I can get my bearings, I fall. Not in any particular direction, but I fall into deep blackness. I am being consumed. ? ? ? ? My eyes open. Cold metal hangs above me. I’m back on the ship; the one that we sail the cosmos in. The metal above me looks strange, though. It takes me a moment to realize that it is suet. Something has burned here. Something burned very hot, but not for very long. I look down, along the length of me. Lya is standing against the wall. Her face is red like she’s had too much sun, and there is a look of fear on her that concerns me. Is something behind me? I look and nothing is there, but her eyes have such terror in them.. and they are fixed on me. I realize that not just her face, but all the skin I can see from my position, the parts that are not covered as she holds a charred sheet up to shield her body that is otherwise clothed only with garments that are cut off in places for comfort and ease of movement, those exposed portions are red from sunburn. This is impossible. We have been in deep space for weeks. There is no sun to burn her. And then it hits me. I am lying naked on a pile of ash.

78521	Fear	78521.jpg	Recap: The weekend was great. Hiked up the side of some random mountain and saw the most beautiful view. I got a tick in my hair for 24 hours. We went to Thai food and made cookies with friends. Struggled through Sunday homework in paaaiinn. Metaphor: The Mountain seemed so small but the further we walked the further away it felt. It seemed like we would never reach the top. It was ominous, looking, distant. Yet the journey was memorable, a memory I will always cherish. And when we finally reached the summit it was all worth it. Every minute of pain heading up was worth that feeling. Reality: I know I’ve got something amazing. I know this is special. I know that this time of my life can be so many things and I know what I am choosing. Some might call me stupid but I feel free. I am finally releasing from the chains that have held me back for so long. I’m free. And my biggest fear is not this freedom. My biggest fear is losing it all, losing what frees me, losing what and who I love. I am terrified to lose this.

Feeling deaf in a crowd of screams Being blind in the rays of light having conversations with silence nothing is happening, the reason I stay in my lonesome,grey ,shade.

78600	Fear	78600.jpg	New Post has been published on Why Your Flaws Are Actually Your Strengths You’re reading Why Your Flaws Are Actually Your Strengths, originally posted on Pick the Brain | Motivation and Self Improvement. If you’re enjoying this, please visit our site for more inspirational articles. flaws and strengths Your flaws are actually your strengths Take a moment to think about what makes you unique. What’s that one thing that makes you feel different from other people in your life? Don’t let yourself get away with believing you aren’t unique, because that’s never true. I’m not talking about something that makes you one-in-a-million unique ?this isn’t a fairytale, this is real life. I mean, what makes you stand out from your friends or coworkers? It doesn’t have to be anything extreme, but I do believe it’s there, and if you get honest with yourself, you believe it too. Maybe there’s a trait you’re not thrilled about. Maybe you’re quiet and a bit uncomfortable in large social groups. Sure, that can be a disadvantage in certain situations, but that’s only one side of the story. People who feel socially awkward are usually a bit too “in their head?to act normally without overthinking things. Thinking too much feels like a flaw in those situations, but having a lot going on in your head can be a huge advantage in other parts of life. You might make a really good writer, comedian or entrepreneur. You probably have a great analytical mind that lot of people don’t. Embrace your uniqueness It’s far too common that people shy away from what they’re good at because they see it as a flaw. Whatever your unique “flaw?is, there’s a path where you can make it work for you. For my whole life, I’ve talked too much. If there’s silence, I fill the void by rambling, and when I catch myself, I feel embarrassed for not being able to just “play it cool? I get so excited and then it’s almost out of my control. Until I considered writing and starting a podcast, it felt like a major personality flaw, but now my non-stop brain chatter is being funnelled into something productive and (hopefully) helpful to some people. I only had to learn how to reframe my flaw to make it something I’m proud of, and you can do the same. This is 2018 ?whatever you’re passionate about, you can build a life around it with enough time and persistence. Fortunately, everyone likes different things, so something you love might be something others can’t stand, and that’s an opportunity. Some people love numbers and problem solving, and some hate those things, but love gardening and cooking. Embrace your uniqueness and let it drive you forward into a place of fulfillment. Failure is still progress Even if you try something and fail, you’ll be in a much better place. If you want it badly enough, you’ll get back up and keep learning. If you realize it’s actually not what you thought it would be, then you can rest your mind knowing that you gave it a shot. If you fail initially at something you genuinely love, you won’t feel like giving up. You might be discouraged, but if you care about it, you will accept that everyone has to start somewhere. You’ll get back up and try again until you break through that barrier, and you’ll thank yourself for doing it. Think about the difference between someone born into wealth and someone born into modest surroundings. The wealthy person may never really need to work. They might be able to relax their whole life, while the other has to work hard for everything. The thing is, working hard in life is like exercise for your mind. It strengthens your muscles for gratitude and fulfillment. Have you ever gone to the gym or done something physically exhausting? When did you feel better, before or after? The wealthy person’s life might be “easier? but easy is the wrong goal. Fulfillment is the right goal. Confronting your fear Fear inside you is an indication of a deeper desire, and it’s not going away unless you face it head on. Ignored fears only fade when they turn to regrets. When you break down what you’re afraid of, the worst case scenario is never as bad as you think. Your fears almost never match up with what you’re losing by listening to those fears. There’s so much to gain and so little to lose, so take that next step today, whatever that is for you. Pat Kelly is a self improvement writer, entrepreneur and host of The Pat Kelly Podcast.

78779	Fear	78779.jpg	Our deepest is not that we are inadequate. Our fear is that we are beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be and Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of Your small does not serve the world. There is nothing about so that other people will not feel around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the of God that is within us. It is not just in some of us; it is in everyone and as we let our own shine, we unconsciously give others to do the same. As we are from our own fear, our automatically liberates others.

78831	Fear	78831.jpg	New Post has been published on Becoming a Proverbs 31 Woman Proverbs is one of my favorite books of the Bible. If there was one book with enough instruction on how a godly woman should live, it would be this one. In today’s society, it can be easy to get caught up in how the world wants us girls to act. We should try to focus on how God views us, instead of how the world views us. This chapter of Proverbs portrays a woman who values God, strength, and generosity from beginning to end. I wanted to break it apart, verse by verse, and see how we can grow into the godly woman God created us to be! She lacks nothing of value. I always read this verse and never knew what it was truly saying. God wants us to value the things he values. He values fellowship, forgiveness, love, and so many other things. We should strive to acquire patience, grace, and all of the characteristics he wants us to have. She works vigorously with eager hands. This verse reminds me to be as hardworking and diligent as I can, in all things I do. Whether it’s my schoolwork or videos for my YouTube channel, I try to put my all into it and give it 110%. She opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to the needy. Have you ever tried giving some of your time to those in need? This isn’t the only verse in the Bible that encourages us to do so. Jesus was always helping, always serving, and always dedicated to others. Try it out for yourself and see how both your heart and perspective change. She is clothed with strength and dignity. As women, we should hold ourselves to high standards. We should remember that with God, being our provider, we will always have all that we need! We should walk through our lives with our heads up high, knowing we can face whatever comes our way. She has no fear of the future. With strength, comes confidence. As Jeremiah 29:11 says, “’For I know the plans I have for you,?declares the Lord.?We can be confident in knowing that the God of creation has already declared our plans for the future. She speaks with wisdom. We should all strive to be quick to listen and slow to anger. We should speak through truth and use our wisdom to guide us. We should be that person in our friend group that can be the voice of reason and leads by example. She fears the Lord. This characteristic is above all others. A godly woman should fear the Lord and abide by him in any and every situation. Dive deep into the word and begin to feel his presence all around you. How will you put this into practice? Will you work toward strength, wisdom, and fearing the Lord? Be the light in other people’s lives so they can see how a godly woman should live! ?Chels

But what happens when a strange figure starts confusing the poor boy? Will she be able to melt the ice inside his heart? Hello tumblrinos, about one or two years ago, a little idea popped into my head. Jack Frost is a very interesting character, and can be used in many different ways.

79182	Fear	79182.jpg	Just as a storm in the atmosphere of the earth is born of conflicting fronts of different temperatures colliding with one another, so too must there be conflicting forces within us in order to form a mental or emotional storm. Our task is to become conscious of these unseen forces that dwell in the unenlightened parts of us. As we grow to realize that no disturbance can remain within us without our granting it the force it needs to sustain its fury, we realize that we have at our disposal two great powers. We are empowered to dismiss storms when they appear in our psychic system and, with time and practice, we can learn to dismiss these disturbances before they begin! What are these invisible conflicting forces at work within us that cause so much foul weather? We uncover the first of these unconscious forces by recognizing that the storms in our lives all share a common cause. Each storm, large or small, centers around something that happens to us that we don’t want to be happening for whatever reasons. A few quick examples prove this insight, but best success is assured if you will fill in the blanks from your own experience. Imagine a woman caught in an emotional firestorm of anger because she does not want to be treated like that. Or a man who feels trapped by a tormenting depression because he doesn’t want what life continues to bring to him. Can we see that these two storms share a common root? Both rise as they do because of our unconscious resistance to something that has already happened. Whenever we face an unwanted event and find ourselves feeling nothing but resistance, we can discover that this stress-mess is made from our insistence that this should not have happened. And how about when we recall past mistakes, painfully reliving how we fell down ?either a moment ago or ten years back? Aren’t we sure that whatever that error may have been ?it shouldn’t have taken place? Which brings us to the following insight that deserves a few moments extra consideration. It feels natural for us to go along with the feeling of not wanting what we are powerless to change! What on earth lies hidden in this strange struggle of ours that compels us to wrestle with what amounts to mental ghosts? After all, once something has happened in our life ?that moment is over; it’s gone, done with, finished. Clearly, what was no longer exists in the here and Now. So, we have to ask ourselves, given this understanding that is above dispute, how can something from our own past feel as real and as alive as it does to us in the present moment? The following answer brings us one step closer to living in a world without storms. Within our mind lingers an untold number of chemically and electrically stored images of the way things were. These mental pictures include complete scenes of every experience past, as well as pleasurable or frightening images of what is yet to come. And these same images are secret storehouses of all the sensations that accompanied them in the moment of their creation. Each one is laden with its original emotional content that pours into us each time we revisit them. To help visualize how this unseen psychic sequence unfolds within, put yourself in the place of this imaginary person ?Barbara ?walking down the street. As Barbara window-shops her eye catches sight of a lace-sleeved lavender blouse on sale in one of her favorite stores. In an instant, Barbara recalls wearing a similar blouse many years ago the night her father passed away. Now, virtually unnoticed, a small wave of regret washes over her. For reasons unknown to her, as she stands there still looking at a blouse she feels sure should be in her closet, she is beginning to think about the last words she had with her father, and how she wishes she would have said something else. The more Barbara is drawn into these flooding considerations, the more she suffers. And the more unwanted this painful experience becomes, the more she unconsciously resists her mounting turmoil until she is caught in a full-blown storm. Haven’t we all been there before? Where a seemingly harmless thought, which we turn over in our mind, becomes a tornado? Well, it need not be like that?for any of us! The only reason we ever find ourselves caught in a psychological storm is because we have been drawn, without knowing it, into identifying with ?actually merging with ?mental images from our past. These images are pre-loaded ?rather like psychological time capsules ?with punishing thoughts and feelings that flood into us the instant we identify with them. As the invisible, but psychically palpable blows from these painful memories pour through on us, we are unconsciously moved to try and resist them ?all of which makes us feel as though we are trapped in a storm about which we can do nothing other than try to escape its lashing! Once we invite the following insight to become our own, we need never again endure the pounding of such negative states: No storm of mental torment or dark, emotional suffering belongs to you. Any wave of resentment, anxiety, or fear that comes to wash you away is nothing more than a kind of psychic residue left over from who you once were. Not only do these negative states have nothing in common with your True Nature, but they cannot enter into the living Now where this higher consciousness lives. This same truth can be said in a slightly different way: we cannot be punished by any painful storm when we are grounded in the present moment. The reason for this perfect protection is as pure as it is simple: psychological storms are powerless to push their divisive and destructive forces into the spiritual harbor of Now because, within Its native wholeness, they have no way to remain there. Now let’s pull these important lessons together in a short summary. We have seen that the storms we suffer are not born simply from any particular event that takes place, but rather they rise from an unknown ground in us due to our undetected resistance to them. Further, these unwanted events that we so strongly resist are not the actual events themselves. What we secretly struggle against in these moments are unwanted images of that event fashioned by ourselves. This occurs, for example, when we imagine a fearful future, or see ourselves thrown for a social loss of some sort. In these moments we suffer, as we do, because we are looking at what we don’t want to see. And then, because we don’t know that we have been tricked into giving these negative fantasies our attention, we try to imagine ways to escape their punishing presence. The more we struggle to get away, the more attention we inadvertently lend to what we wish would disappear! It’s a great paradox: not wanting to look upon what is bothering us keeps what is bothering us in plain view! But now we are beginning to see our way out of this trap. From this moment forward, whenever some dark storm appears in us we must neither run from it, nor stand there and hate what we think is happening. Instead we must awaken to ourselves, bring ourselves back into the Now and quietly, deliberately, drop any image that our thought-nature presents within us to justify the brewing conflict. Learning to dismiss the storms that sink our chances to be happy takes dedicated inner work, but you may be assured such powers are possible. Your True Nature already dwells beyond the reach of self-wrecking storms. Join it; begin Now! (Excerpted from “Let Go and Live in the Now??Red Wheel/Weiser, 2004)

79359	Fear	79359.jpg	Taking this advice this year! So far I think it’s going well. Challenging but well. Remembering that love comes in many forms. As does fear. When I can remove myself from fear (fear of loss, fear of making the wrong decisions, fear of change, fear of the unknown, fear of loneliness, fear of life) then I gain so much more honest clarity. And life starts to make more sense. It’s not always easy, but it’s certainly more smooth. And I can at least say goodbye to the pit of despair within that threatened to swallow me whole?.

Envision roots coming from your feet and branching out into the earth. Feel stability and release any insecurities. A cool technique I have recently learned is when any negative thoughts pass through your mind, imagine a balloon popping it along with that thought. Purge fear. Your root chakra will spin and be released from blockages when you practice this. Thanks Master Yoda for your wisdom.

79641	Fear	79641.jpg	The older I get, the worse my fear of heights seems to get. As someone who loves hiking and rock climbing, and goes to a school in the mountains, I feel extremely restricted. I’m finally trying to take this fear into my own hands and see what I can do to overcome it. Today, I have combined some research and used my own experiences, from overcoming past anxieties and mental illnesses, to compile this outline. I have come up with a “Fear Scale?method, similar to what helped me overcome my eating disorder. While making this outline, I felt really good. Knowing who I am and how my mind works, this is a method I feel very hopeful about. Tomorrow I plan to complete the list with a second method: meditation/visualization. At the end of the spring, I plan on section hiking the NJ-NY section of the Appalachian Trail. This is a dream of mine. So, going forward, this year, I fully intend on putting it to use. I have 4 months to overcome this barrier. Lucky for me, I have a super supportive boyfriend who is willing to help me every step of the way and a persistent personality. I doubt my fear of heights will ever go away, so coping methods are where time should be invested most. Phobias are real. Fear of heights is called acrophobia. It tends to cause physical symptoms that make it more than “just being scared.?This is the most terrifying thing I have ever dealt with in my life. I am challenging myself to do this, and promise that if I succeed, I will write a book about it. I would love to help people struggling in the same way. Everyone deserves to live a calm life, and phobias create the opposite. If these methods work for me, I would be more than happy to write a detailed list on here for others to see!

My English will Probably tell you to shrug it off and ignore everything As if nothing would have ever happened. And that’s the thing. My English will not tell you what is Being said or done wrong. It probably won’t even tell you About the left over ignorance that’s lodged in the back of your mouth. My English will tell you that there is nothing wrong with the way you look. And I thank God everyday that my Spanish is still within me. Unlike my English, my Spanish will tell you about the one Time you went to my family dinner and how you almost Spilled the false tale of what was once your life because Both you and I know of the mistakes you have made. The only Other reason why my Spanish would bring it up is because My Spanish is constantly reminded of the things that have Brought you here to your accomplished tragedy.

For a long time now, our mental healthcare system has focused on just relieving symptoms. But that’s like if you went into your doctor with knee pain and all they did was diagnose you with Knee Pain Disorder and give you something to cover up the pain without looking into why it’s there. Go after causes instead of playing whac-a-mole with mental illness symptoms. Blow up the base of the mountain and the top will fall down on its own. Change beliefs and change practices and the experiences will naturally change from there.

The most obvious example of this attitude is the punishing of 'bad women,?where being bad means failing to give men what they want.

79756	Fear	79756.jpg	“Trapped?. Bien, este es uno de esos dibujos, de entre tantos que hago por ocio o por placer, que realmente cumple la función más profunda del arte: la comunicación, la transmisión y sobre todo, la expresión y exteriorización de los sentimientos de quien produce una obra. Realmente me debatía si escribir esta explicación sobre el significado de este en especial. Tanto por que pensé que perdería esa gracia de abstracción, como por que no me gusta mostrar mi lado más débil. Aquél que siente miedo a todo?Pero es una manera de desahogarme. Después de todo, para eso existe el arte, ¿no? ¿Nunca han tenido la sensación de estar solos, a pesar de que estén rodeado de personas que te quieren? ¿Nunca han sentido miedo? Miedo a no ser lo que los demás esperan. A decepcionarlos. A demostrar quien eres en realidad, tu lado más sensible, por que sabes que lo más seguro es que se burlen de tí. Que te desprecien y que incluso las personas en las que tenías más interés por conocerles te repudien. Es un sentimiento que me invade constantemente. Lamentablemente, la única respuesta que he encontrado con el tiempo es crear una especie de coraza, una armadura que me protegiera del daño que los demás pudieran hacerme, y a su vez, del daño que yo pueda hacerles a ellos producto de mi ineptitud. De mi estupidez. Una “máscara? Sin embargo, es difícil mantener las apariencias durante mucho tiempo, e inevitablemente siempre termino mostrando el peor y más mundano, despreciable aspecto de mí. Y por más que luche, intentando enterrar esa máscara en mi carne para que los demás no tengan que lidiar conmigo, inevitablemente…la basura que soy, el monstruo terrible que hay en mí, logra asomarse de entre las rupturas de mi disfraz. Una máscara de porcelana resquebrajada, que ahora no hace más que dejar brotar mis agrias lágrimas de entre sus ojos. Por ser…quien soy.

80145	Fear	80145.jpg	Dear Poet, Tonight I am thinking about the guy laying beside me. The guy who pulls me closer into the cradle of a strong body radiating heat every time I shift in my sleep and kisses my bare shoulder in the middle of the night and whispers “You’re beautiful?to my ears only when he thinks I’m asleep, and most of the time I am. Tonight, Poet, I am thinking about how he laughs when I say stupid things and brushes his hand across whatever part of me is closest to him when he’s playing video games and glances my way just to make sure I’m still there even though I haven’t moved. I wonder why he does these things, and I’m thinking it’s because he’s betting his last shred of hope on me, as I am him. Tonight I’m thinking about how bittersweet I get when he talks about his childhood and how the misfortune of mine could never compare, he’s too good for the horrors I have embedded in my memories, the ones that have molded the way I behave and perceive and think. The ones that are the reason I so desperately want to forget where I’ve come from. Tonight, Poet, I’m wondering if he notices how I second guess even the slightest actions I make, or if he can hear me warring with myself over the decision to say something I so badly want to, worrying if it’s to bold or thinking of every possible response he could give me in answer, weighing the pros and cons five times over and calculating ever possible outcome because I am so terrified of yet another rejection from a fellow human being. Tonight, Poet, I am sitting in a coffee shop waiting for him to get off work just so I can feel him against me for another night because as stressful as my mind may seem when I’m around him, his closeness is what I have always been missing. Tonight I’m wondering why, after all the burns that have been so happily branded into my skin and so easily dismissed, I only have love to give. I’m wondering why I happen to be one of those people who only wishes to take care of others, even others who stay for the smallest fraction of my existence. I’m wondering why I try to sympathize with the people who are the reason I’m clutching my pillow at 4am, chest aching like my heart is trying to tear itself apart, if only to stop it from hurting. I’m wondering why I allow myself to torment at 4am, sobbing like I did when I was a little girl, so so desperate for comfort that will never come. Tonight I am hoping, with everything I have, that he doesn’t turn out to be like every father, brother, uncle or lover that has placed their brand behind my eyelids when I sleep, that he won’t become a part of my nightmares, or my 4am tears. Tonight I am thinking about how much I love him, how much I love myself, how much I want to give him and how much he gives me. I’m thinking about how I hope to god I never have to sleep in an empty, dark house again, and how terrified I am that all the effort, all the faith and all the hope in the world won’t save me from his leaving. Tell me, Poet, what kind of poem could you write to capture all of that?

80167	Fear	80167.jpg	Fear is a disease that permeates the depths of the human spirit. It causes procrastination; it requires that you have the perfect opportunity, the right amount of money, even the perfect dream. Fear gives you excuses for why something can’t be done and wraps it up in being realistic and practical. Fear robs you of possibilities and you won’t even notice until you’re on your deathbed wondering “what if…?There is no perfect time to start a business, have a child, or see the world.

Anyways on to the point of this post. My goal this year is to take everything I’ve taught myself with guitar and music as a whole to the streets, to the audience(meaning via straight live gigs and online streams for whoever is reading this) around the world. The goal is set up as a way to drastically improve my performance, to fail more than I’ve ever failed in the past years. I won’t lie, this has to be my scariest goal yet(My Youtube covers come prerecorded, so even though they are real and have real mistakes but, they are free from another actual person in the same room so fear-wise, they are nothing compared to what I’m set to do this year)but I’m going to push through day by day. So here’s to all of us trying to move out of our comfort zones and actually adapting and improving ourselves and our lives to greatness!

On the left is an original game protagonist, Eva. Deathly afraid of water, her existence probably factored toward my love for The Dragon Prince and its aquaphobic heroine, Rayla. The fan art on the right appears, to me, ridiculously superior to the original piece on the left, which I thought was very professional at the time. I find that poetically amusing. Water is so common in my artwork, and that isn’t going to change anytime soon, I’d imagine.

80983	Fear	80983.jpg	“These are larger, more embracing terms than contemporary Christianity is in the habit of using. But we are taught that Christ “was in the beginning with God; all things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made?The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.?The present tense here is to be noted. John’s First Letter proclaims “the eternal life which was with the Father and was made manifest to us.?We as Christians cannot think of Christ as isolated in space or time if we really do accept the authority of our own texts. Nor can we imagine that this life on earth is our only life, our primary life. As Christians we are to believe that we are to fear not the death of our bodies but the loss of our souls. We hear a great deal now about the drift of America away from a Christian identity. Whenever there is talk of decline—as in fact there always is—the one thing that seems to be lacking is a meaningful standard of change. How can we know where we are if we don’t know where we were, in those days when things were as they ought to be? How can we know there has been decline, an invidious qualitative change, if we cannot establish a terminus a quo? I propose attention to the marked and oddly general fearfulness of our culture at present as one way of dealing with the problem. In the twenty-sixth chapter of Leviticus we find a description of the state the people of Israel will find themselves in if they depart from their loyalty to God: “The sound of a driven leaf shall put them to flight, and they shall flee as one flees from the sword, and they shall fall when none pursues. They shall stumble over one another, as if to escape a sword, though none pursues.? [from New York Review Of Books: "Fear?by Marilynne Robinson] [from Alive On All Channels]

81312	Fear	81312.jpg	One of the first energy sessions I went to I learned a lot about self-worth and the fact that mine was really low on the scale. This was the first bit of awareness I had around self-worth at all. I didn’t even really know what it was until it was presented to me. A few years ago I started reading A Return to Love by Marianne Williamson and I learned that we have two choices in life: love or fear. Every thought, word, or deed can come from a place or love or from fear. I realized I was doing most things out of a place of fear instead of choosing love. I now know that the best choices we make come from a place of love - especially when it comes to our love for ourselves! 💕 One thing I love about The Healthstyle Emporium is that we have amazing webinars on many different subjects. The one I joined today was all about knowing your self-worth. We went though some exercises to really know where you’re at on your worthy scale!

81490	Fear	81490.jpg	New Post has been published on Diego Stocco - Sound Composing Fear from his DIY Nightmares Covering both the subject of last month’s DIY and this month’s of Fear, we spoke with Diego Stocco about his work as a sound designer, composer and performer. Diego creates eclectic musical experiences with custom built instruments and experimental recording techniques. He loves discovering hidden sounds from organic sources, objects and materials, with an unorthodox musical curiosity that allows him to produce music with sounds that have never been heard before. Recently, his creations have been conjuring fear in audiences around the world as part of the ad campaigns for “Annabelle: Creation?and “IT? Diego StoccoDesigning Sound: Did you have any formal education in sound or music? How do you feel a formal education can either aid or detract from a person’s creativity? Diego Stocco: I’m mostly self taught. As a child, I was eager to learn about music and music technology. When I was 6 years old, my introduction to music began when a friend showed me a Bontempi Hit Organ. I bugged my parents about that thing until they bought me one. I also had a brief and turbulent classical training, which ended with an expulsion from the local Conservatory of Music when I was 12. After that, I did a couple more years of music theory with a private teacher, which later enabled me to teach piano and choral singing at a private school where he was the musical director. I learned the basics of Pro Tools while working in postproduction, but in my spare time I came up with a bunch of tricks to work with loops and audio (this was around the time Pro Tools 3 just came out) and that allowed me to come up with my own technical/creative approach. I certainly see the value of getting a formal education, as it can be very useful in providing a set of coordinates to follow. By doing so, it can possibly reduce the amount of time wasted on wrong approaches. However, creativity is something different than education and I don’t think it can be taught as a set of lessons. Creativity is a mindset, it’s an inner instinct that someone has; something that can be expressed even with a rudimentary knowledge. A creative mind can use education to push their work further, but going through college for a number of years does not automatically turn someone into a creative person. The Arcophonico, one of Diego’s numerous custom built instruments and part of his “Custom Built Orchestra?project.Designing Sound: When did you start creating your own sounds, instruments, patches and what inspired you to do so? Diego Stocco: It was a gradual process that started when I was a kid. I was trying to get familiar with synths, samplers and studio equipment as much as I could. I spent many afternoons at the local music store trying out the same stuff over and over before being able to buy a little thing to take home with me. My first gig as a sound designer was creating sound effects for radio IDs. After that I did a few projects with Korg Italy, programming synths and making samples. A big step forward was when I started working with Spectrasonics. I was using their sample libraries when making jingles and I was inspired by their sounds. I wanted to make a good impression, so I spent almost a year working on the concept of a sample CD, a cinematic sounding construction kit with ambiences and grooves. I wanted to create something different, not traditional instruments or drums. I started recording what I could hear around me. Noises coming from the computer, the chair I was sitting on, random objects, and then processed them in a very meticulous way. After sending the demo and receiving positive feedback, I flew to L.A. to meet Eric and Lorey Persing. I was incredibly excited for the opportunity to do something together and for a moment my jaw hit the floor when they told me that they were done doing sample libraries. At that time nobody knew about it, but they were going to be releasing their first virtual instruments soon. They loved my sounds and offered me to be a part of this new journey, so the ambiences became part of Atmosphere and the grooves later became part of of Stylus RMX. Since then, as you can see in Omnisphere 2 I kept experimenting with more recording techniques, sound sources and custom built instruments. One of Diego’s custom recording techniques, a lavalier microphone attached to the bow as part of his “Music From Nature?project.Designing Sound: Do you have a specific design process whether for sampling, designing and creating acoustic instruments or software patches? Diego Stocco: It depends on the sound I’m creating. If it’s based on a custom built instrument, there’s a construction phase first, followed by a musical/performance phase. In order for me to know if an instrument can translate well in a sampled form, I need to know that it can be playable and make musical sense. Sampling is a pretty time consuming task so I wouldn’t want to start recording something and later figure out that it’s not that inspiring. If I’m creating sounds for my own compositions I work differently. It’s more like performing and processing in the context of the piece. I start with something simple, it could be a rhythmic part, and then add something on the top. Usually I record different options so that I can choose the one I like the best. Designing Sound: How do you come up with the names for your original instrument creations and patches? Diego Stocco: It’s a mix of things and languages. It could be inspired by the shape of the instrument, like the Arcophonico, where the idea came from an arched piece of wood I found on the street. It could be the inspired by the sound it makes, like the Sub Bass Column. It could be based on the original use of the materials, like the Fence Bass, built with a fence pole. And finally, it could be based on the idea of trying something experimental, like the Experibass (as in Experimental + Bass), where I initially intended to test a physical modeling concept in real life (violin, viola and cello strings on the body of a double bass). Diego exploring the sonic possibilities of the Adidas Boost material.Designing Sound: In your recent work for Adidas Boost, you manipulated the material in variety of ways. While some techniques yielded compelling sonic results, others, I imagine, were less successful. What role does “failure?or fear play in your creative process? Do you find that with experience you “fail?less often as you become better able to predict sonic outcomes or premtivly design towards a goal? Diego Stocco: Every time I start a project like that I know that I’ll have to try different ideas before I find the optimal approach. Failure is part of the learning experience, especially when trying new things. In some occasions I thought I had a great concept in mind, but then it turned out to be disappointing when put into practice, or even dangerous. In the beginning I had to test things out more to know if they were going to make sense. For example, testing different mic setups, sometimes too complicated. Now I can look at an instrument and get where I want much faster with a simpler setup. A metallic sounding custom built instrument called Fence Bass which you can see in action here.Designing Sound: What do you look for and appreciate in the creative tools you use and what developing technologies are you most excited about? Diego Stocco: I like a well designed workflow, it makes the experience of working with that plugin or hardware much more powerful. So far, when it comes to AI applied to sound and music, I’ve heard some underwhelming examples. Something exciting in theory doesn’t necessarily translate as inspiring in practice. Maybe in the future we will hear some incredible work coming out of AI, but for now it looks like they’re still training those systems. Augmented Reality seems promising. It might be worth focusing on different ways to achieve human expressiveness through new kinds of controllers, possibly going beyond physical playability. The technology might be there already or it could be created. Imagine being able to control the complexity and emotional color of a sound by simply thinking about it. Diego processing the MiniBrute through his “Insanity Machine?Designing Sound: You’ve recently been doing work for movie trailers. Do you see yourself more as a composer or sound designer that area? Diego Stocco: I am focusing on trailer music again and releasing my own catalog. In trailer music the sound is very important and experimentation is welcome. Having a range of custom instruments allows me to create pieces with complex and unique sounds. There’s not much distinction for me between being a composer and a sound designer. I compose with sounds as I compose with notes. Would the term Sound Composer make sense? A prepared Cymbalom Diego made as part of his “Camera Obscura?album.Designing Sound: Some of the trailers you’ve worked on recently have been within the horror genre. Are there any common elements that you identify in the sounds you create that make them “dark? “scary? “horrific?? Diego Stocco: It is a genre of music that comes naturally to me and it’s also in the nature of some of the instruments I build. I’m interested in finding sounds that are harmonically rich, and play things with unusual tools like forks, pieces of wood and whatever I pick up from the floor at that moment. A dark sound can be created by playing a solo instrument in a very intense way, rather than relying on a large orchestra. Processing my custom built instruments can also lead to interesting sonic direction. Camera Obscura is my most recent album. It’s an industry-only release, but you can find two medleys on my website that will give you an idea of what I’ve been working on recently. Designing Sound: Is there any advice you could give when it comes to creating something truly original and taking a DIY approach to sound and music? Diego Stocco: Ironically, the first thing I would recommend is not to try creating something truly original, because the expectation alone could send anyone into an endless loop of: is this truly going to be original? I would probably focus on coming up with an interesting question and see if there’s a way to answer it. For example, when I made Music From A Tree the idea was very simple, can I play a tree tonally? Twigs and strings looked similar to me in the way they behave, so one day I grabbed a double bass bow and tested the idea. Another thing would be to figure out what resonates with you the most. For example, I always found a single note on a piano to be more than just a note. The way a bass note evolves, with the harmonics, at different dynamics, it’s very interesting to my ears. Each piano sounds different, and it’s really interesting to try to manipulate those harmonics, like in a prepared piano, or by messing with the tuning. I did some sounds for Omnisphere 2 where I retuned down the last two high octaves of an old piano, the timbre that emerged was really a surprise, almost like a bell but still tonal and warm sounding. Finally, connecting with your roots can provide a sense of direction for your work. I grew up in Italy in a family of people who built and fixed stuff, my Grandfather was a truck driver and had a garage with all kinds of tools. I enjoyed watching him fix things, so now I incorporate that DIY approach into my work. My Father is a butcher, so sometimes I butcher musical instruments and recombine the parts into something different. My Mom is the most artistic person in the family, and even though she’s not a musician she was the person who was willing to listen to my little compositions when I was getting started. The way I see it, a person is a like a remix of the people who influenced us the most, so you need to listen to yourself and pay attention to the notes that feel more familiar. A big thank you to Diego for answering our questions about his fearless work in the art of sound creation. You can find out more about him on his website, www.diegostocco.com, and on his Gumroad and Vimeo pages.

Make sure that those things aren’t compromised by the people who surround you.

82481	Fear	82481.jpg	04.10.17: Träumerei, Protest, Herz und Finsternis “I’m not crazy, I’m just a little impaired. I know right now you don’t care. But soon enough you’re gonna think of me. And how I used to be, me.?# Matchbox 20 - Unwell Ich denke nicht, dass ich verrückt geworden bin. Ich glaube aber, dass ich mich sehr gut in vier Teilen lasse. Vier mal ein kleines bisschen Faktor “Ich?was dann das Gesamtergebnis ergibt. Jede Seite tritt immer für die Gruppe auf aber überlappen tun sie sich eigentlich kaum in ihren Ansichten und Eigenschaften, einer hält das Steuer und die anderen geben Ratschläge. Gruppendynamik beschissen 1-A. Wie komme ich auf so etwas? Naja, wir geben Dingen Namen, wenn wir versuchen sie zu verstehen oder nicht? So habe ich mir auch viele Namen gegeben, wenn ich nicht wusste was gerade mit mir abging. Mir wurde nur leider erst vor kurzem klar, dass ich nicht die jeweilige Stimmung benannt, sondern meine Seele gespalten habe, sodass sie einander kontrollieren und helfen können. Hier sind sie nun für euch, die Namen von dennen jeder von euch mindestens einen kennt und keine Ahnung hatte von den anderen. Moon “I’ve said it once, I’ve said it twice, I’ve said it a thousand fucking times. That I’m ok, that I’m fine, that it’s all just in my mind. But this has got the best of me and I can’t seem to sleep.?# Bring me the horizon - It never ends Ich hier bin vermutlich der, der am längsten ohne Namen auskommen musste, obwohl ich fast schon immer da war. Die Namenswahl passt aber eigentlich sehr gut, obwohl dieser nur aus einem dummen Scherz heraus entstanden ist, oder Jay? Eigentlich bin ich ein relativ stiller Zeitgenosse, ein Träumer, ein Romantiker wie er im Buche steht, ruhig und besonnen, aber gib mir einen Stift in die Hand und einen Aufhänger und ich kritzel dir seitenweise Blätter voll und wenn ich ehrlich bin, geben mir die Welt und die anderen Deppen genug Stoff um ganze Wälder dafür abholzen zu müssen. So funktioniert die Inspiration aber, oder nicht? Sie kann nicht immer nur im guten Sinne entstehen.Trotzdem bin ich sehr froh, dass sie mich rational entscheiden lassen, was für die Welt verträglich ist und was nicht. Incu “I can hear your cries a million miles away. Just that same broke feeling on a different day. And if you choose to rise, then we’ll find a way. To get up, and get out, and break off that same old page.?# Burden of the Sky - Same old page “Er meints nur gut? das rede ich mir jedes mal ein, wenn er wieder irgendwas unverantwortliches tut. Jedes mal, wenn er denkt, dass die Welt wieder mal nen ausgestreckten Mittelfinger vertragen kann. Da kommen dann so Sachen raus wie 140 km/h auf der Landstraße (04.04.2015 never forget), aus Protest Streiterein anfangen oder einfach mal wieder unschuldige Bäume verprügeln. Wenigstens konnte ich ihm die Aggressionen die er früher gezeigt hat, halbwegs ausreden, aber ich will nicht wissen was passiert, wenn er nach all den Jahren mal wieder über seine Grenzen getrieben wird. Dieser Tag wird kommen und er macht uns scheiße sehr viel Angst, sogar Nox.. Eigentlich sind das wirklich nur Ausnahmefälle, meistens hockt er einfach nur stundenlang vor dem PC und wir gucken unserm Retterlein gespannt zu, wie ein paar drei Jährige sitzen wir dann einfach nur da rum und halten alle die Klappe. Max “I need a cure for me ‘cause the square doesn’t fit the circle. Give me a remedy 'cause my head wasn’t wired for this world.?# Bring me the Horizon - Avalanche Ohje, ohje.. Unser kleines Opferlamm.. Einfach gesagt, der, der alles ausbaden darf, wenn Incu oder Nox wieder irgendwas angestellt haben. All die Trauer, der Schmerz, die Einsamkeit, alles landet bei ihm. Ihr kennt ihn vermutlich nur als den Kerl mit dem freundlichen Lächeln, der es allen Recht machen will, liebevoll und hilfsbereit jedem (und ich meine das wörtlich “JEDEM? zur Seite steht. Seine Geschichten schreibe ich am liebsten, sie zeugen von Gefühl, positiv sowie negativ, sie sind detailliert beschrieben und es fehlt nichts, da er einfach nichts vergisst. Sollte also in einer seinen Storys etwas fehlen, ist das meine Schuld (er redet manchmal einfach wirklich viel zu viel). Nox “I can’t help the way my mind is hardwired to hate myself. 'Cause I swear that this is hell. The way I desperately try to save myself. 'Cause I can’t save myself.?# As it is - Can’t save myself Nun zu unserem letzten und jüngsten Protagonisten. Der treibenden Kraft hinter diesem Blog. “Hey Moon, du musst heute noch was für mich schreiben, hab da ne Idee. Los, los, los!?und das an jedem gottverdammten schönen Tag der Woche. Habt ihr auch so einen Freund? Dem immer gigantischer Müll einfällt? Genau das ist Nox, nur viel, viel, viel schlimmer und um einiges gefährlicher. Das Problem dabei, aus seinem Mund hört sich das Alles nicht so schlimm an, lügen und verführen sind genau seine Stärken. Wo wir drei andern in Harmonie zusammen leben, bringt er nur Chaos und Wahnsinn, wenn er los legt ist Achterbahn, Gedankenkarussel vom feinsten. Sobald dann alles wieder in Scherben liegt, jeder gute Gedanke erfolgreich ausgelöscht wurde setzt er sich wieder grinsend in seine Ecke und sieht uns zu wie wir wieder versuchen alles zu reparieren. Naja.. wie ich und Incu versuchen alles zu reparieren.. Hier Fragen sich mit Sicherheit manche von euch warum ich oben das Wort “Protagonist?verwendet habe, weil an sich klingt das hier nach dem genauen Gegenteil, aber er war nicht immer so. Es gab Zeiten wo er einfach nur den ganzen angesammelten Hass aufgesaugt hat. Aber irgendwann, als er genug hatte, kamen seine wahren zerstörerischen Absichten zum vorschein. Ich glaube auf seine eigene kranke Art und Weise versucht er auch nur uns zu helfen.. So, dass bin ich nun, willst du mich verstehn, dann musst du sie alle vier verstehen, was zugegeben, ziemlich anstrengend ist. Das ist vermutlich auch der Grund, warum fast jeder geht bzw. sich distanziert der mehr als zwei Seiten kennen gelernt hat. Also sag mir, glaubst du, dass du damit klar kommen kannst?

So out first day is for Favorite Movie. This was actually harder than I thought it would be but Inside Out has to take the title. While it is made to be a children’s movie, it has elements in it that even adults can relate with. The writing was good, the story was great, there were no magical endings, and the actors chosen for the roles were spot on perfect. I don’t really have any bad things to say about it which is why it took the spot. What is your favorite?

83106	Fear	83106.jpg	For the inaugural question on this blog, I am seeking an answer to a question posed by Hank Green on his CrashCourse channel. Namely: why is C-3PO capable of fear? For that matter, why program him with the ability to feel fear? The simple answer, proposed by Hank in his video, is that George Lucas wanted it that way. It’s hard to argue against this idea, but it also fails to answer the question in-universe. Finding a rationale within the Star Wars universe is my goal here. The first in-universe reason that comes to mind is his programmer: Anakin Skywalker (as of Episode I). Of course, an enslaved boy working with scrap material would have a hard time adequately encoding his project with the same emotions as other droids. This raises a further question (to possibly be answered later): why even give droids emotions, or the appearance of emotions, if they mostly perform labor and subservient roles? It seems a bit mean to me. Anyway, this answer doesn’t seem adequate to me, considering Anakin’s exceptional ability with mechanics. Between his ace-pilot skills and scrapping apparently worthless material for the construction of droids before he reached the age of 10, it seems unlikely that Anakin would allow such an obvious flaw into the program of his droid. Far more likely, it seems to me, is the likelihood that Threepio’s fear was an intentional part of his construction. To understand this idea, we have to look at the evolutionary reason for fear - why is fear present in humans? In what way is it helpful to urinate oneself when stressed out? How does the “deer in the headlights?look benefit humanity? To get to the bottom of this idea, let’s consider a primitive human. Perhaps they’re part of a small tribe or a loner. Either way, at some point in their existence, they likely come upon a threat that they are unable to handle - the kind of threat modern humans rarely encounter. In this situation, it is very helpful to feel fear. The threat, be it a big cat or another human, is less likely to see or chase after you if you are either paralyzed by fear or otherwise unappealing to deal with (i.e. smelling like urine). Threepio exemplifies several of these characteristics, in a much more droid-like manner. He describes feelings of doom-and-gloom and even specifically states the odds of surviving any given encounter. These comments are more than annoying, they are actual survival strategies. A complex understanding of the difficulties of one’s situation, and the likelihood of death, are helpful in avoiding a fatal outcome. So, the real question here becomes: did Anakin choose to program C-3PO that way, knowing that he would likely face a nearly impossible existence as a protocol droid on an impoverished, crime-infested desert planet? Or did he sub-consciously program him that way because he held many of the same feelings and developed the same survival strategies?

83407	Fear	83407.jpg	365 Day Movie Challenge (2017) - Fear (1996) - dir. James Foley As promised, my Summer of Witherspoon rolls on. Fear is a pretty mediocre thriller, but I can see why audiences might have enjoyed it in the spring of 1996: there’s sex, there’s violence, there’s a soundtrack featuring the Sundays (their cover of “Wild Horses?that seemed to be everywhere throughout the 90s and early 2000s), Bush, Toad the Wet Sprocket and, yes, even Marky Mark. Reese has her work cut out for her as a teenager who makes the mistake of thinking she has fallen in love with a new guy in town (Mark Wahlberg); long story short, Mark is a psycho and he will stop at nothing to have Reese to himself, including torturing/trying to kill her father (William Petersen, more likeable than I usually find him), stepmother (Amy Brenneman), young stepbrother (Christopher Gray), best friends (Alyssa Milano and Todd Caldecott) and even the family dog. There is no lack of Sturm und Drang in Fear, which means that it’s an entertaining film, if also a totally ridiculous and unbelievable one.

83445	Fear	83445.jpg	Living For Me Living in the closet is hard. Its suffocating. Its tiring. Having to constantly hide an important part of your life is exhausting. It has come to the point where I can no longer do this. It is time to come out or to end this forever. I have too many dreams. Too many things I want to do. I want to live. I want to live as a happy openly gay man. I remember being a kid, praying everyday that I would wake up and this feeling will go. Pray that I will no longer be gay. God never listened to that prayer. So, maybe God made this way. For year, and years, I lived in a shadow. Work, studies and keeping busy kept me going. It made me go on. But, now, it has been too long since I have been living in the dark. It is time for me to embrace myself. To love myself. To be allowed to love myself. I am a proud gay man. Your hate won’t change that. Your anger won’t change that. Your opinions and thoughts doesn’t matter. Tomorrow my family might kick me to the streets once more. Tomorrow those who said they were my friends might leave me. Tomorrow I might get killed on the streets of home. But today, today I am happy. And that is what matters most to me. And I know, that those who truly cared for me, they will continue to stay with me. Yesterday, I lived for you. Today and tomorrow, I live for me.

83661	Fear	83661.jpg	by Adrianna In an effort to state “low lights?because we are so used to only posting our highlight reel on social media?I give you my lowest in the past year. On November 8th Trump was elected, and as soon as that sunk in I had a panic attack. For those that haven’t had one, it’s debilitating: hyperventilating, crying, buckled over, trying not to black out and screaming. I screamed: BUT I CAN’T BE A PILOT! Once I settled down, a relative term here, and thanks in part to Jason, he asked me why I would say something like that. “Because Trump is going to bring war and I don’t have 20/20 vision - so I can’t be a badass pilot, I will be infantry and die in the first wave.? I went back to therapy, clearly filled with more anxiety on top of my GAD (general anxiety disorder) and finding it hard to sit still. Fast-forward to August 2017. Trump and North Korea. Mass media and hype. Anxiety peaking. I am one toe-stub away from breaking down, I can feel it. BUT I have too many things to do to have time for a breakdown…ah, you see that’s how I get around this. If I fill my time with 6.5 jobs, hobbies, dog walks, and whatever else - my brain has no time to process the anxiety. I’m exhausted CONSTANTLY. I have become twitchy and snippy, ready to burst out in tears or rage. I can’t hear news reports without getting my heart rate up; the mere mention of Trump sends my blood pressure through the roof. But I have a show to open in two days that I can’t focus on But I have a new job that has a deadline in 8 days. But but but? I am dealing, I am struggling, I am managing. I hope you are too.

I am no longer a dreamer. I am hopeless. All the hate, all the fear. The realization that I have made so many mistakes. It all comes running back. It fills me quickly and completely.

I didn’t know it was an elephant; I thought it was part of the furniture.?There comes an aha-moment for some folks - the lucky ones - when they suddenly recognize the difference.? ? Stephen King ?

84337	Fear	84337.jpg	My sister started to be afraid of airplanes when she was on her 20s. I used to call her crazy. “You have travelled so much. How come you’re suddenly so afraid? Nothing has changed. Everything is still the same.? I didn’t realize how fear is a defense mechanism. She fears feeling trapped; by responsibilities, by a job she doesn’t like, by our parents?so of course, she fears being in a huge metalic cage during hours, without the option to just leave everything and hop out. I fear intimacy. And so I used to cover myself, I used to be afraid of what my body could do, I used to avoid his gazes. But now, I am discovering myself again. I am proud of being me, with everything that entails. I look at him directly into his eyes. I tell him this is my body, and it is ours to enjoy. Somedays, I will hate myself. But other days, It will be glorious. Stay, and see it feel it for yourself. And my sister?my sister is in love with a boy that lives on an island. So she travels by plane. A lot.

84380	Fear	84380.jpg	How do I get over the fear of running into my ex boyfriend? Few weeks ago I told him I wanted to end our FWB/casual relationship because I was unhappy and had feelings for him. I cut him off, nicely from my life. Now Im very scared to run into him?I never want to go out because of it, I have high anxiety. I don’t know how I will act around him. Fear is essential for survival. The mere reason that you are afraid today will be the reason for your survival tomorrow. I dont have a solution for you to get out there and start living a normal life, as its easier said than done. So I will rather suggest you to take some time, there is nothing wrong in acknowledging that you are going through a bad phase. But along with that you also need to realise that this phase has to end, and you cant just stay back home for the rest of your life, hence, with time you will have to find your way out of your room and the bad phase.	
84398	Fear	84398.jpg	I know I shouldn’t be afraid of the uncertainty and the unknown, and just go for what I want, but I’m constantly feeling over whelmed if they are right decisions, for me, and for the people around me. The fear of jumping into something and failing and having done it for nothing makes me nervous, and I don’t want my family to judge me for making certain choices. I mean, sure, if it fails and falls apart, I know my dad will let me come home with open arms and try and get my life back together, but I don’t want to do that yet another time to him, and I don’t want him to thinking that moving a further 2000kms away from him is what I want. I want to be close to all my family, but it’s hard when half of them live over the other side of Australia.

84484	Fear	84484.jpg	Think of love as a stream of water that flows with us wherever we go. We can step into it, or out of it at any time. We can wade in it, swim in it, or refuse to go in at all, but every thought or action puts us into love or moves us out and away from it. The question of how we know we are in love is answered by the question, how does it feel? When we are thinking and behaving in love, it feels good. When we are outside love, it usually does not feel good. However, an important distinction here is that pleasure is not love. Pleasure can come from food, drugs, alcohol, sex, gambling, buying, or the intoxication of infatuation when we get so wrapped up in another person that we fail to see their reality. Love is not exhileration, but comfort and serenity. We know we are in it when we are having feelings of serenity instead of some form of fear or excitement. When we are in love, there is a feeling of abundance, and we want to share it. Love can be shared through sex, but so can selfishness, and sex is more about desire. Love is best shared as communication of caring, compassion and affirmation. When we are in love, we automatically want others to be in the stream with us, and we find ways to invite them. It is the same stream for all of us. Our stream is their stream. The simplest way to understand it is that Love is something we step into or out of, move toward or away from, share or refuse to share, with every thought we think, and every action we take, and in every moment of our lives, it is always equally available to all of us.

84825	Fear	84825.jpg	The LS Some people who have followed me for a while knows I suffer periods of paranoia, especially after exposing myself to horror movies or comics. I can’t always control my brain and convince myself all that stuff hiding in the dark isn’t real. Other times my brain just goes to create its own monster without a source and does its darnest to convince me this thing is real and right behind me. Or even in front of me to a point I really believe I’m seeing it. It sucks. When this thing began to appear, a friend convinced me to try and draw it. To give it a source and make it more mundane and clearly not real, so I could get it out of my head. And what ya know, it worked like a charm. Haven’t seen the LS in months since then (LS stands for Little Shit, it was what name I could think of) and felt it was safe to share these sketches. Finally got a tool against those things in my head. Enjoy!	
84845	Fear	84845.jpg	Avión presentó fallas técnicas y piloto pidió a sus pasajeros rezar una aerolínea de bajo costo, tuvo que devolver un avión Airbus A330-300, con dirección Australia-Malasia, luego de que comenzara a sacudirse debido a una “falla técnica? según advirtió la compañía. “Estábamos dormidos y escuchamos un fuerte ruido pasadas cerca de 1 hora y 15 minutos? dijo el pasajero Damien Steven, según consignó CNN. “Se sacudió durante todo el viaje de regreso, cerca de dos horas? Stevens también señaló que, en dos oportunidades, el piloto pidió a los pasajeros que rezaran y que mantuvieran una posición de emergencia unos dos minutos durante el aterrizaje. “Estuvo muy agitado, dio mucho miedo? dijo Stevens, quien junto con su amigo Mitch Jamieson estaba en camino a Myanmar por vacaciones. Y no fue el único que sintió temor: “Pensé que podría morir? escribió en Instagram. Finalmente, tal y como señaló un portavoz del aeropuerto de Perth (Australia), “el piloto identificó una falla técnica con el motor. El avión dio la vuelta y aterrizó con seguridad en el aeropuerto de Perth? Una vez que aterrizaron el avión rompió en aplausos y el piloto saludó de mano a todos al final del vuelo. Aunque no está claro que fue lo que causó el problema con los motores del avión, cualquier falta de balance dentro de un motor puede provocar vibraciones violentas que se sienten en todo el aparato.

See, she has epilepsy and has found this ribbon bracelet that stands for finding a cure for epilepsy, I liked it and asked for one too. See, my mom has a very unique case, she has no family history of epilepsy, she has had no head trauma to cause seizures like a concussion, and brain scans to monitor the neurons during a seizure are inconclusive, it’s as if they don’t register or fire during a seizure. Curing epilepsy is one thing, but my mom is such an unique case that we are going to need a lot more help to find a cure for her specific case, and the unlucky few who also in this condition. So if you want to show your support, look online for this bracelet and other purple ribbons. I know, I should have gotten the website where mom got it, but I’m sure it’s an easy find.

85109	Fear	85109.jpg	Fear Word count: 1701 (this part contains smut) Part 22 After two hours your eyes were still closed. You looked still and peaceful, like there was nothing happening around you. Kai stayed by your side, his eyes glued to you, waiting to see your beautiful eyes again. Everyone checked up on you, but Kai was the only one who stayed by your side because he knew you would wake up any minute. Everything that you and him have been through went through his mind. All the good things and all the bad things, but they were still your memories and he cherished them as much as it was possible. You shifted on the bed and all of a sudden started coughing. You quickly opened your eyes and sat up, calming yourself down. You looked around the room and glued your eyes to Kai who had a big smile on his face, a dash of hope and happiness splashed across his face. You placed your hand on the place where your werewolf bite was and traced it with your fingers, feeling only the smoothness of your skin under your fingertips. You furrowed your brows and looked at Kai, unable to comprehend how quickly your wound disappeared. ‘How- how did you heal me? Did you manage to get Klaus?blood??Your hands were placed down on the bed in front of you, your fingers intertwined. 'No, I siphoned the magic out of you and it healed.?Kai replied and showed you a shy smile before he looked down at his feet, feeling shy as if he saw you for the first time and you were just a beautiful stranger that agreed to go on a date with him. 'You saved me. I- I don’t know what to say except thank you, Kai.? 'You don’t need to thank me. You know I would do anything for you to make sure you’re safe.?Kai trailed off and locked his eyes with yours, their colour intensified while they stared deeply into yours. 'I need to and everything you’ve done for me and what I-?he cut you off by pressing his lips on yours gently, his hand finding its way to your cheek. He placed a lock of your hair behind your ear, brushing his thumb against your cheek as he pulled away, but still stayed close enough. 'I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have.?He apologized but you pulled him in for another kiss, his tongue slipping into your mouth slightly, fighting for dominance. You pulled him onto the bed on top of you, your fingers burried in his hair, gripping on it lightly making him moan into your mouth. 'We don’t have to.?Kai whispered. 'Please. I need you.?You said and he obliged by kissing you again, his fingers tugging at your light top, sliding his hand under it and cupped your bare breast with his one hand, while he was supporting his body with his other hand, your legs wrapping around his waist. You bucked your hips up, his crotch meeting your coated heat, turning him on ever more. He tugged at your shirt again and slowly took your top off, your chest utterly exposed to Kai. His fingers trailed down between your breasts to your belly button and then when you needed him the most. He pushed his hand inside your underwear, his index finger pressed on your clit and making small circles, getting you closer to your release by each second. You instinctively pushed your legs more apart, your fingers still tugging on Kai’s hair, your mouth slightly opened as he kept staring at you, watching your every move, your every face expression and how you reacted perfectly to his gentle touch. You closed your eyes and threw your head back, feeling your climax approaching as you clenched your walls a few times and then felt your orgasm tearing through your body, making you cry out Kai’s name in pleasure. Kai pulled out his hand and pecked your lips, your hand slipping down between your bodies and pressed on his lenght as you started palming him through his jeans, but he stopped you and removed your hand, pinning it down on the bed next to your head. 'I want to make you feel good.?He whispered and started kissing your neck gently, your fingers tugging at his shirt, pulling it over his head, revealing his toned torso, his skin pressing on your bare skin. It felt like your skin was on fire, like everytime he touched you, it hurt you in some kind of way but it also made you want him even more. He pulled away and planted his feet down on the floor and started unbuttoning his jeans and pulled them down along with his boxers, his hard lenght setting free as you watched his every move and bit your lip at the sight. He climbed back on the bed and tucked his fingers into the sides of your underwear and slowly pulled down your panties, throwing them down on the floor. He came closer and placed himself between your legs, his eyes locked with yours. 'I missed you so much!?Kai whispered and kissed you deeply as he pushed into you, filling you out completely, the feeling of him stretching you out reminding you just how much you missed him too. You opened your mouth slightly as he slowly withdrew himself almost completely and then went back in at an agonizingly slow pace, filling you up to the hilt. He was thrusting slowly and carefully, allowing you to feel every inch of him, your back arching and making your breath hitch with almost every thrust he made. 'Kai.?You moaned out and bucked your hips up a little bit, forcing Kai’s hips into yours at a different pace. 'Go a bit faster.?He obliged but it still wasn’t anything like before. He was making love to you, slowly and with a lot of love and passion. 'I’m not gonna last long.?You whispered. 'Me neither. Just hold on for a little longer.?He moaned out and kept thrusting at a bit faster pace, hitting your g - spot constantly, your moaning getting more obvious with each thrust. You felt yourself coming closer to your release, instinctively closing your eyes. Kai groaned at the feeling of your tight walls clenching around his thick shaft and sped up a little bit. You couldn’t even speak up as your second orgasam traveled through your body, your walls clenching around him and pushed him over the edge, spilling inside of you, thrusting all the way through yours and his orgasm and at that moment, a tear streamed down your face. Kai stilled himself and pulled out slowly, collapsing down on the bed next to you, covering you both with a large blanket. All of a sudden you started crying, Kai’s finger placing under your chin and lifting it up a little bit so your eyes met this. 'Hey, did I hurt you??Kai asked gently, concern in his voice. You shook your head quickly and placed your head on his chest, listening to his fast heartbeat. 'Then what is it?? 'Nothing important.?You lied. What you and Kai just did was wonderful, but it didn’t feel right. In fact, it felt like that was the last time you would do that and it felt like all of this would go away. 'Are you sure??Kai asked again, giving you a gentle kiss on your forehead. You nodded and closed your eyes, wiping your tears away. 'You can tell me if something’s wrong, you know that.? 'I know, I just. Can we stay like this for a little bit??You asked him, caressing his bare chest with your delicate fingers. 'Of course.?He replied. You closed your eyes and after some time, you fell asleep. You were extremely tired even though you were at your full strenght. You weren’t wounded anymore, at least not on the outside. On the inside, it was a completely different story. You slowly opened your eyes and looked to the other side of the bed, but Kai wasn’t there. You sat up and put on some underwear and his shirt that was too big on you. 'Hey!!?Bonnie spoke up and entered the room, quickly walking to the bed and sat down. 'You look amazing! And look there’s no bite!?You faked a smile and looked down at your fingers. 'Yeah. I guess so.? 'Ok, what’s wrong??She asked, knowing you too well and you couldn’t hide anything from her. 'Nothing, nothing’s wrong.?That’s a lie. 'I’ve known you my entire life. Spill it out.?She ordered and punched your arm playfully. 'I- I don’t know, I don’t feel like myself anymore. I don’t feel- happy.?You muttered, a smile disappearing from Bonnie’s face. 'You’re not happy with Kai??She asked. 'I think so. Don’t get me wrong, I love him with all my life, I really do, but I would give anything to have my old life back where everything was normal. Sort of. Life where I was a witch, having fun with learning all the new spells or hanging out with you guys. It felt like something that would last forever, but somehow I just don’t feel it anymore.?You trailed off and looked at Bonnie, a hint of pain splattered all over your face. 'Did you tell him?? 'No, I- I can’t hurt him like that.? 'You have to. I know how you feel about him, but you’ll hurt him even more if you keep pretending that you’re happy. I’m sure he would understand.?Bonnie trailed off, as you couldn’t stop thinking about Kai. He deserved someone better than you, someone who’d be happy with him. You showed Bonnie a weak smile and ran your fingers through your hair and plopped yourself back down on the bed, torturing yourself with your own mind. I slowly and quietly walked downstairs and found Damon sitting on the sofa next to the fireplace with a drink in his hand. I approached him and sat down on the couch in front of him and crossed my arms as I managed to speak up. 'We need to talk.'

85126	Fear	85126.jpg	A Soni Day Devotional Revelation: You can be free from sin and bound by fear. God didn’t give us a spirit of fear because in Him fear doesn’t exist. Fear exists within the bounds of humanity. You can feel fear and not be bound by it. Jesus was in so much anguish and duress that he sweat blood before going to the cross but for the joy set before him he endured the cross despising it’s shame. Fear didn’t bind him, it freed us through Jesus?power, love, and self-control. We have that same spirit. Fear only binds you up when you allow it to get you down. Find your strength in the truth that you can feel fear and not be afraid. Prayer: Lord thank you for example in the garden before the cross. Thank you for being the example of pressing toward the mark of the high call. Help us not to live in fear and be bound by it. Whom the son sets free is free indeed. Help us walk freely. In Jesus name I pray, amen.	
85127	Fear	85127.jpg	I revealed to a fellow Zircon shipper my Feanger headcanon that Fear is all in on the cuddles while Anger is so not a cuddler. It makes me wonder where the Zircons stand on cuddles, since Blue is pretty timid (though Yellow is more sassy than angry.) And yes, I like Feanger. I know what you’re thinking, doesn’t Anger beat up Fear in the movie? Wouldn’t that make their relationship abusive? I have a headcanon to explain that. If Fear and Anger became a couple, and Anger cares very deeply about things being fair, he would of course try to control his rage as to not hurt Fear. Instead Anger would probably just punch walls or break furniture when he wants to be physically enraged. Worst it would get is if Anger slips up and does hit Fear, leaving Anger very apologetic and with some character development to make so he can control his anger better, for Fear’s sake.

86066	Happy	86066.jpg	New Year 2017/2018 ~ I spent the end of 2017 getting out of work at my usual hour when its pitch black and all the traffic lights on the roads go out. I had debated about visiting my family for new years before heading home. As tired as I was and eager to go to sleep, I decided to venture there anyway. The ending of 2017 was a very rough one for my immediate family as our grandfather had passed Christmas morning. Christmas was not merry, nor was it “holly?or “Jolly? It was spent in sorrow, with a funeral and with intoxication to dull the pain. My father has been in pieces ever since. I thought only best to have all of his children there with him to bring in new and probably harsh year. Family is very important during these trying times. However when I arrived, expecting everyone to be half asleep, everyone was gleeful, laughing, smiling, hugging, dancing and singing. Almost as if tomorrow were the end of the world and everyone was spending their last moments alive together. I couldn’t help but feel the same way. There were even people there I was meeting for the first time who also got wrapped up in the over joyous cloud of authentic feelings. My dad and brother were wasted and actually enjoying one another. We eventually went out and lit fireworks like every, usual new years eve practice, but some how that night felt so very different. It is kind of hard to describe it, but it felt empty and whole all at once. Light and dark. Happy and sad. Bittersweet. The feeling was so raw and real…I just can’t quite explain it right but remembering how happy everyone was in that one hour I sat there makes me grin from ear to ear. It made me realize that no matter how many times I have been beyond pissed at my parents, annoyed and aggravated at my brothers, and the pure stress/anxiety that comes with being around my family…none of it matters. The fact that they are THERE to make me feel these things DOES. Within that hour of chaotic joy and stupidity I found myself laughing and smiling at how much I love them. How much I’d miss them if they weren’t there to light the stupid fireworks and have me yell at them for being immature and dumb. I am glad I stopped by after work and yelled “Happy new year!?from the top of my lungs into a burning night sky. They made me feel every emotion that night and I even cried to myself in my car on the way home, replaying the night over and over in my head although it had only been an hour out of my 100 year lifetime, I don’t ever want to forget the way it made me feel. Life truly is too short, and it REALLY is the little things that make life so grand and mysterious. ~

87048	Happy	87048.jpg	How to Upgrade your Day Choose Happiness ☺️💪💋 This seems simple enough. 💁🏼‍♀️But for some of you it’s a heavy choice.🙇🏼‍♀? You may have trained your brain to think of the worst case scenario or maybe your insecurities cloud your true choices and passions from coming into fruition. 😞 Is it possible to choose happiness in EVERY moment? 💁🏼‍♀️Sure- anything is possible. What is the benefit? A happier fuckin life. Ha ha. 😂🤣 the best concepts are usually the most simple, right? 💜 Happiness should never (have to) be forced however? Gently nudge your thoughts towards a more positive outlook or idea. 🤜🤜🤜 This leads into manifesting and 💍 I wholeheartedly believed in this idea for the first time I watched “the secret?and it works. 🌟 But then something shifted and I thought it was a load of crap. 💩 I’m beginning to rediscover the missing counterparts 💡that make this concept true - and choosing happiness in your thoughts (past, present and future) will catapult you in the right direction and build the foundation. 🔜

87177	Happy	87177.jpg	É ano novo !!! Ao começar de um novo ano é comum desejar novidades ter ambiçoes usamos palavras como Renovação para dar vida ao desejo de fazar compuir tais promessas Albert Einsten dizia a seguinte frase’?Loucura é querer resultados diferentes fazendo tudo exatamente igual!?Sendo assim a palavra é renovaçao mesmo! Fazer o novo, um ’‘novo?de novas açoes, mas é necessario cuidado pois é comum as vezes nos enganarmos renovaçao com refazer a açao Mas basta se ater ao conselho e Einsten que se resume a fazer açoes diferentes resultam em diferentes resultados. Mudar de habito, reestruturar rotinas podem ser dificeis mas a logica é inquestionavel. Que tal somar essa inspiracao que vem com o ano novo e um plano para alcancar os objetivos. Alie-se ao deslumbre do futuro. Pense e repense e se for necessario nesta caminhada use mais uma vez de “Renovaçao? Podemos desejar um feliz ano novo e mais que isso podemos fazer um ano novo.

90029	Happy	90029.jpg	I look at the smooth and slow flowing water. I wonder what it would be like to move forward and never look back. Or never stay or be in the same place twice. I can stand there for hours just to watch the water and to hear the water. I see my reflection. As I watch my reflection in the water I see my sad expression and wonder if the water can see me. I run my fingers through the water. I see many ripples appear as if the water is flinching from the pain I’m causing it. I wonder if the water can feel me………feel my pain. I wish I could float on the water and let it carry me anywhere and everywhere it goes. I step into the water. I feel the coolness of the water and I start to shiver. I feel my body relaxing, I feel my heart go from racing to freefalling. I concentrate on the sunny and blue sky. I start to float. I feel the water pass by me I realize that nothing in the world can take away this feeling……?The feeling of me happy.

90701	Happy	90701.jpg	It has been just over fourteen years since the release of Greatest Hits: My Prerogative by Britney Spears!!! I remember when I had bought the album, it was at Circuit City because I knew about their $7.99 deal on CDs!!! I also remember how my older sister was mad at the fact that I wanted to buy the CD. I hadn’t come out to my family yet. Anyway, Happy Birthday to Britney Spears!!! She turns 37 today!!! (12/02/2018)	
90713	Happy	90713.jpg	Motivation Monday!!!! I had another one of those moments where I’m sooo glad I took photos because trying to see the FULL change in the mirror just doesn’t cut it. I could’ve sworn I was still at Day 39 but nope!!! And I think there is at most a 3lb difference between day 39 and 88, which says a lot about how unreliable your weight can be in regards to progress. I’m so happy and ready to go on vacation to Aruba in 3 days!!!! 😁 - 4 months ago I was in a very healthy mental state and I was ready to be healthy physically again, too. I loved my body then, and I’ve grown to love it even more now. Reaching new levels, pushing my limits, and seeing myself get to places I’ve never been before is so invigorating. I’m so glad I’ve dedicated myself to these changes and gotten such an amazing support system to keep me going! - - if you’d like to follow my ig:kristavonwalter ☺️

I hope I can become a better human every day, to become a better son of you, God. I hope that my words made you think about things that are really important because my biggest dream is to help people in achieving their dreams, to motivate & inspire and also to become who they really are. If my words stay in your mind and make you feel something real & beautiful, it served its purpose. created by foreverlittleboy

Счастливых выдают глаза, Как боль душевную слеза. Сильней, чем клятва, Да и вера в чудеса. Счастливых выдают глаза, Что светят яростно и ярко. Как на морозе жар костра, Трещащий искрами огня. Счастливых выдают глаза, Когда бушует ураган душевный. И это всё прекраснее, ценней подарка, Глаза, наполненные счастьем. -Неизвестный автор

I hadn’t felt tremendous loss yet and I had no idea what the next 9 months would bring. I didn’t feel like I ever had to fake a smile - I was always plastered with that big cheesy grin. I’ve grown and I’ve learned and I’ve loved so much since then, and I will always continue to - to remember who I am, and who I wish to be.

98204	Happy	98204.jpg	Day 262 - Tuesday, September 19th, 2017 My face is glowing because for the first time in a little under 4 months, I have went to the gym. I worked out. I sweated. And I smiled. And it was wonderful!!!	
98216	Happy	98216.jpg	Вот иногда бывает так, что один сон, действие или воспоминание окунает тебя в прошлое, заставляя флэш-беками вспоминать свою историю, в которой присутствуют те люди, которых уже нет в настоящем. Отсутствие тех или иных «кадров» радует, а вот о некоторых мы все равно тихо продолжаем грустить?И неважно по какой причине их нет: твоя ли это вина, так сложились обстоятельства или они уже не в этой жизни?Чем старше становлюсь, тем больше понимаю, что нашу жизнь - прошлое/настоящее/будущее формирует не только твой выбор, решения или судьба, но и отсутствие/присутствие тех или иных личностей. И иной раз бывает непросто разобраться правильно ли, что их нет? (at Moscow, Russia)

98298	Happy	98298.jpg	Dordrecht, Holland. by remoscarfo: If you haven’t been to Holland’s oldest city, Dordrecht, I highly recommend checking it out. Not only does it have notable historical landmarks, but the old-town area is easy to navigate and you can reach Dordrecht fairly quickly from major cities like The Hague, Amsterdam and Rotterdam…and it’s off course a very good combination if you want to visit the Windmills from Kinderdijk the are just a 10 minutes away from this medieval city :-)

100377	Happy	100377.jpg	~Here’s the second part!!! Thank you for your help and dealing with me and thank you to for inspiring the story!~ Chapter 2 Happy’s POV You had been avoiding me for a week now and I was starting to get pissed. I tried a couple of crow eaters after you but none of them fit right. They didn’t moan or move the right way, not like you had and it left me completely frustrated. At least, I wasn’t the only one that you were avoiding. You had pretty much been avoiding all the others boys since they kept hounding you over who it was that fucked you. Since you had missed the party friday night, the boys had been discussing your new guy a lot. “Why would she ditch us for some new guy??Juice pouted. “How d’ye know i’s th?same guy??Chibs asked Juice. “Could be more’n one.? “You think??Tig perks up. “Like at one time??The boys all laugh. “Perv.?Juice shakes his head with a smile. “What? Come on! I can’t be the only one to have thought about her like that.?Tig said. “I mean she is really pretty.?Juice blushed. “Aye,?Chibs nodded in agreement with Juice. “Even Chibs agrees! See!?Tig smirked. “I agreed th?lass is beau’iful, Tiggy, no?tha?I’ve had debouched thoughts o?‘er. Tha’s you, ye bloody pervert.?Chibs told him. “Fine but fuck! Just imagine bending her over that desk in the office.?Tig groaned and I froze in my spot. “I gotta admit, Tiggy’s got a point on that one. Especially if she’s wearing that tight pencil skirt.?Jax piped up and all the boys?eyes got glazed over looks. I nearly let a growl escape as they all thought about fucking you. “Bitch doesn’t know her place, can’t keep her mouth shut, and doesn’t respect the kutte or the men wearing them.?I rumbled and everyone looked at me surprised. It was the first time I had participated in the conversation and it hadn’t exactly been in the same direction. And then Juice started to laugh which caused some of the others to chuckle. “You mean she doesn’t respect you??He asked with a smirk and that sentence had everyone laughing. I growled and got off the couch. I stomped out of the clubhouse with the boys all yelling “Sorrys!?and “Come back!?behind me as I left. I jumped on my bike and very quickly made my way to your house, I parked around the block. I had been to your house once before when Chibs had made me drop some stuff off. I made my way up your sidewalk and to your front door. I began to pound on the door hard and I almost ended up hitting you in the face as you opened the door. Shock was written all over your face as you took in the fist in front of it. I put it down and you looked at me with a raised eyebrow. “What the hell!? You just about fucking hit me in the face!?You said angrily. “Almost, I didn’t though.?I pointed out with a smirk. “Oh, I know you didn’t because if you had, I would be going to visit one of those famous little hiding spots of yours to get rid of your corpse tonight. ?You put your hands on your hips and that’s when I took in the sight of you. All you were wearing was a long SAMCRO shirt obviously one of the guys at the clubhouse. I let out a growl and crossed my arms over my chest. “Who’s shirt is that??I demanded. You looked down at the shirt and let out a giggle as you looked back up at me. “Why? You jealous??You asked with a smirk. “Hell no, little girl.?I growled and took a step towards you. “Then you don’t need to know who’s shirt it is.?You replied with a fake sweet smile and a wink. “The fuck I don’t; I don’t much care for crossing swords with my brothers and not knowing it. For fucks sake, have you MET Tig??I snarled before grabbing your hips and pulling you close. You started laughing hard and I had to grip your chin hard and force you to look at me before you stopped laughing but still had a bright smile on your face. “Well he is the reason I have the shirt.?You said with a cheerful voice. My grip tightened and I let out a growl. I was about to say something when you cut me off with, “He spilled his beer on me.? “What??I asked, surprised. “Tig was drunk and in his drunk mind he thought that spilling his beer on me would be the perfect way to see me without a shirt on. So after he spilled the beer on me, I smacked him upside the head and went to a random room. Which was where I picked up the shirt.?You explained slowly like you were talking to a child. I smirked and pushed you into the wall while kicking the door shut behind me. “Naughty, little girl. Stealing shirts, avoiding me, and giving my brothers naughty thoughts about you.?I growled and I felt you shiver underneath my hands. “Maybe I should punish you.?I leaned down and started kissing your neck, which caused you to moan. “Happy…?You moaned as you grabbed my kutte, pulling me closer. I grabbed your ass and lifted you up. I pulled back and looked you in the eyes. “You want me to punish you little girl??I asked with a smirk. You bit your lip before nodding slowly. “Bedroom though.?You demanded and I chuckled. “Where is it??I asked. You pointed to a hallway. “Last one on the right.?You told me and I nodded before carrying you to it. I sat down on the bed with you straddling my waist. My hands slowly lifted up your shirt and I noticed your black lace panties. “Fuck?Stand up.?I demanded and you actually listened. “Shirt off.?You slowly took it off with a little smirk on your face. I leaned back on my elbows as I took in the sight of you in those lace panties and nothing else. “Off now.? “Demanding much??You asked in a sassy voice. “Do it now, little girl, and I’ll make your punishment enjoyable.?I told you. You rolled your eyes but took them off. I motioned for you to come closer and sat up straighter. You came and stood between my legs. I grabbed your legs slightly and ran my hands upwards to your stomach then up to your breasts. You let out a moan as I squeezed them. I smirked and moved my hands around to your back and then down to grab your ass. I moved my hands to your hips and turned you around. Even though they were mostly healed you still had my handprints on your ass and I felt pride while looking at them. I turned you back around and made a hum noise as I thought of all the things I could do to you. “Are you going to do anything or you just going to stare at me all night??You asked. “Watch your mouth, little girl, or I’ll stuff my boxers into it.?I said with a wink.You made a noise of disgust and glared down at me. What I wasn’t expecting was the hard punch that you landed to my shoulder. I chuckled and pulled you on top of my lap. “That was very naughty.? “What ya going to do about it??You challenged. I rolled us over so you were pressed into the bed and I was above you. I leaned down and kissed you hard. You moaned and kissed me back just as hard. I pulled back and looked down at you. “Do you trust me, little girl??I asked. “Honestly? No, not really??You answered and I chuckled. “Just close your eyes.?I told you. You sighed and did as I asked. I softly took each of your hands in mine and moved them above your head. You squirmed slightly and I smirked as I looked down at your body. I hadn’t had much time to look at it last time. I leaned down and took your nipple in my mouth, sucking hard on it. You moaned and your back arched, it made me smirk at how responsive you were. I took both of your hands in one of mine and moved my one hand down to my side. I bit down on your nipple and you grabbed my shoulders hard. I chuckled and sucked on it harder while I reached inside the pocket on the inside of my kutte. I switched nipples and did the same thing while making sure you were thoroughly distracted before pulling the handcuffs out of the pocket. I reached back up and slowly began to handcuff you to the headboard waiting to click them till the very end. “What the fuck??You asked angrily. “What? I told you to trust me.?I smirked. “Where did you even get these??You asked while looking up and tugging lightly. “You never know when you’ll need cuffs.?I chuckled and winked at you. “This isn’t funny, Happy. Get me out of these things.?You told me. “Nope, you are going to get your punishment.?I smirked before getting up and you whined at the lack of contact. I chuckled and took my kutte off and placed it on your dresser. I started to strip and once I was finished, I stepped back so you could get a nice long look. Your eyes darkened and you bit your lip as you took me in. “See something you like?? “Eh, I’ve seen better.?You smirked. “Liar.?I growled and climbed over top of her. I leaned down and swirled my tongue around your nipple. You gasped and your back arched into my touch. I ground down against you and your legs wrapped around me, I growled loudly and bit your nipple playfully. I reached down and grabbed your ass as I continued my assault on your nipples. I rubbed my cock against your folds and that made you moan my name loudly. “What do you want, little girl??I asked as I rubbed harder against you. “Happy…?You whined. “That’s not an answer.?I chuckled and grabbed my cock. I rubbed the head over your pussy. “Now tell me, what do you want?? “Fuck! Fine! I want you! I want you to fuck me!?You practically yelled. “As you wish, little girl.?I slammed into you hard and I moved the hand that was on my cock, back to your ass. I squeezed it and started thrusting in and out of you fast. I moved from your breasts to your neck, marking and sucking on it as I thrusted. I moved faster and our moans filled the room, mine were slightly muffled by your neck. You pulled against your restraints as I lifted your ass up to get a better angle. “Happy! There! Yes!?You yelled out and I felt you starting to clench around me. I smirked against your neck and quickly pulled completely out of you. “No! Happy! Please, I was so close.? “I know.?I smirked and looked down at you. You glared up at me and struggled against your restraints. “You bastard!?You growled up at me. “You said you wanted a punishment, little girl.?I reached down and circled your clit softly and slowly. “Happy??You whimpered as your hips went up to try and push my fingers against you more. I kept the light pressure on your clit though and it made you whimper more. I smirked and added a little bit more pressure which caused you to make the hottest sound that I’ve ever heard. I groaned and kissed up your stomach as I moved faster and harder against your clit. You moaned and I pinched and twisted your clit. Your hips bucked up hard and you moaned out loudly. “Fuck! I’m?. Fuck!?I started rubbing on it hard for three more seconds before pulling away again. “Sorry, little girl.?I smirked and you pulled against your restraints more. “Fuck? Happy! Please! I?I need this. I need you!?You begged. You looked at me with pleading eyes as they filled with tears. “Please…?Some tears escaped and you whimpered softly. I cupped your cheek and wiped the tears away then I kissed you softly. You kissed back, managing to deepen it somehow. I pulled back with a growl and reached down to grab my cock. I teased your pussy for one second before entering you again. I tangled my fingers in your hair and pulled back slightly as I thrusted in and out of you. I couldn’t stop myself from taking you roughly and leaned down to kiss you hard. “Fuck! You feel so good…?I growled out. “Y…You? Too…?You let out between gasps. I moved in faster and hard as I tightened my hold on your hair. It didn’t take long for you to cum and once you did I followed. I thrusted in and out as I rode our orgasms out. I collapsed against you, keeping most of my weight on my elbows. Once my breathing and heart rate were back to normal, I undid the handcuffs and rubbed your wrists softly. “These are going to bruise.?I told you. You smiled sleepily. “It was worth it.?You mumbled softly and I chuckled. “Time to sleep.?I told you gently as I let your wrists go. You nodded and then curled up on your side. I smiled and pulled your blanket over you before getting up and putting my clothes on. I left your house as quietly as possible and rode back to the clubhouse. ~I hope you enjoy~

101259	Happy	101259.jpg	One of my closest childhood friends just sent a group of us this picture and I was reminded of how I use to feel, when I saw pictures of myself with short hair. I felt extremely embarrassed and didn’t want anyone to see pictures of me when I was younger. Now looking back feels the exact opposite. I can see the amazing beauty in how my parents allowed me, to be me and support me when it became difficult due criticism for dressing and looking different then what society expected. From clothes to haircuts on the exterior and more importantly encouraging me to truely be myself and follow what brings me the most joy. The same year this picture was taken, at the age of 7, I became the female Canadian National BMX champion for the first time and maintained that title for 7 years in a row after that, until I retired. “The privilege of a lifetime is being who you are?- Joseph Campbell

Um coração puro é aquele que só observa. Ele se expressa através de uma mente equânime, pois assiste as misérias e as alegrias sem se identificar. Através dele, o fluxo de vida e de amor não é interrompido. Ele está além dos dramas e dos jogos da natureza inferior, e sempre vibra em gratidão. Ele está sempre celebrando a vida (o sol, a lua, as estrelas, o vento, as flores, o sorriso? e tudo que se expressa através do ser humano, porque compreende que tudo é sagrado; tudo faz parte do jogo divino. Esse coração é um símbolo que representa o seu Eu mais profundo.? - Sri Prem Baba 🙏🐻😁🎈 (em Beco do Batman)

105270	Happy	105270.jpg	3 years ago today, at 4pm, I told Sergio to go home and sleep. We had been at the hospital since midnight and they said I’d be there for another 5-8 weeks. One hour later, 538P to be exact, I’d call him as he was walking in the house to tell him the baby was coming and come back as quickly as he could. They were already taking me. The nurse told me, with as much compassion as she could, ?I’ll stay with you.? knowing how fast everything was happening, I’d deliver without anyone there. Another chimed in “We’ll all stay? And they did. Right before the first incision I hear a whole lot of whispering. I ask out loudly Yes I said loudly, because we know how I am) what everyone is talking about. “Your mom is here and we are sterile. We don’t know if we can let her in.?The head of anesthesiology has the last word and it’s a no from him. The nurses are pleading with him and my mom is scrubbing in, just in case he changes his mind. The doctor says something in code and the room goes silent even though everyone is moving around. The no turns into a weird, sullen “Let her in? The back and forth was long enough for Sergio to get there and he is scrubbing in as fast as he can. They are losing the baby. He’s delivered and we can’t even see him. They put him in a transporter and he disappeared behind door. Sepsis, underdeveloped lungs, jaundice are a few of his issues. He’s the smallest thing I’ve ever seen. Twice they told me I NEEDED to come to the nursery. My uncle Herny came and prayed over him. His sister cried when she saw him. And now, 3 years later, we got a big boy! Fine and strapping and inquisitive and beautiful and a KING!!! BIRTHDAY

106248	Happy	106248.jpg	What Gifts Do You Have to Share? We are all uniquely gifted. What gifts have you received and what do you have to share? This past week was my birthday. I was lucky to connect with family, enjoy dinner and conversation, kayak around Austin belly laughing, and lazily enjoy the pool. I returned from vacation, 9 days at Baptiste Level 2 in the mountains without cell service and limited internet. Coming back into a full (jam packed) week flooded with stimuli had me question the greater purpose of what I am doing and how I am contributing to the world. I notice I feel unfulfilled at the end of the day if I am not fully sharing gifts with other people. Whether that is time being present, supporting friends through tough times, coaching others…if I don’t give and share, I feel stuck. Sweating can seem like a religion. A practice to cleanse spiritually and push yourself physically. This week I told myself I needed rest, I got to a breaking point of exhaustion from moving from one thing to the next without intention, and overall noticed how centered I was on the state of being in my body. Coming off the mountain, of Menla or any retreat or transformative experience, made me feel to uncomfortable. The discoveries made, seeing my life from a new perspective, cracking open the rawness of emotion after numbing for so long, and accessing power to vitality, self-love, and newfound strength seemed awkward to walk in to an old schedule. I questioned everything from the car I owned to space I lived, and even the work I create in the world. I learned that in my life, it is essential to take it slow. This Sunday morning I slept in, gave up caring what I put on the calendar / setting self-timers, and committed to having a true, slow, Soulful Sunday. I was moved to tears on the morning walk with my Labradoodle puppy, Zoey, as I knew today would be the time that I surrendered to resisting forming Own I.T., the company and non-profit. As I sit on the bench at Lady Bird Lake, being in awe of nature and getting present to gratitude, I had to pause for 45 min. to write this post. Recently I went into “hibernation mode?a.k.a when you don’t know what to do, do nothing for the past month. I needed space to consider, at least that’s what I told myself. I could write a novel on the considerations and doubts I had, but I’ll spare the time. The single reason I am going to launch Own I.T. (and spend time with the legal paperwork) is because it is a gift. Own I.T. is for others and it’s a gift meant to be shared. It’s an access to professional freedom, leadership, and authenticity. The magic of creating this comes from synergy and the ideas and support of others, a question of “how can you help?that I discovered I was timid to ask. Before Level 2, I didn’t fully grasp the personal power or leadership within me until I was on the mic teaching to 130 yoga teachers without having planned it ahead of time. So cheers to July 23, the first Sunday and week of my 28th year of life, being dedicated to creating something much larger than myself as a fun, creative, full expression of the amazing gifts given to me. What I noticed is that one part of me felt immensely courageous and the other side was completely terrified. Identify your gifts. Get present to what you have to share. Share yours gifts openly and lovingly. As a single twenty-something living in a new city, I deeply miss my community in Houston. I miss the people who allowed me to unravel and loved me anyways. What I am connected to is how my community - family, yoga, friends, ZTA, is bigger than any city. If you’re curious to your greater purpose and wanting to discover your direction or True North (yoga reference), start giving your gifts away. Discover what it is like to share what you have from a place of abundance. Stop concerning yourself with the past. Start unraveling and letting go of ways that don’t serve you.

106299	Happy	106299.jpg	Transferred Happy into her new home. She should be good in here for another year or two. I gave her an adult male dubia roach as a housewarming gift, which she quickly snatched from the tongs. It was her first adult dubia, and her first prey item with big wings, so she didn’t quiet get a good enough grip on it and after getting dragged around by the roach a bit she ended up dropping it and did not want it back when I offered it to her again. I ended up killing the roach and leaving it in her small web in the corner for her to find later and this morning I found her happily munching away on it.

106745	Happy	106745.jpg	This pictures was taken days before I met the girl I swore I was going to marry, the one who flipped my world upside down. just In both good and bad ways. One I wish I might have met at a different time maybe now, but anyways there’s point to all of this. Though it says 1 year I must have just posted it late, so to help with time a little this was actually almost 4 or 5 years ago. Before I was struck with a itch to well try anything, this was me completely sober probably just getting home from. Practice or making up dance routines. Just being me, who you all know and have learned to love or even hate. That girl in that picture is what I wake up and strive to get back everyday. Not only striving for excellence but almost becoming addicted to always seeing the good. I had substance rob me of my light for 3 long years and ya know what as we all know I am nothing but human. I still fuck up, so with all that mumbo jumbo that has some of you probably jaw dropped at this point cause I “don’t fit the description of an drug addict, well I was. When they say don’t judge a book by its cover, I guess we could say that’s a fact. This week has just been a really crazy one for me. Last year around this time I was in gwinnett medical fighting for my life because I wanted to enjoy life on all of my favorite past times, leaving me lifeless in my foyer for all of my family to see, frighten they were I could only imagine. Upset, angry, even more mad at me I bet. But there was nothing happy about me this time last year. Now I’m doing what it takes to find the key and though it’s a never ending cycle at least with the tools Ive learned on the way it’s a hell of a lot better than waking up dope sick. Can I get an AMEN! THIS IS FOR ANYONE AND EVERYONE struggling with anyways, there are brighter days and you aren’t alone. I love you even if we have never met. I care and am here if you need me.

109066	Happy	109066.jpg	Let’s talk about this for second.. in a temporary world it is so hard to find someone who is genuinely going to be there to invest in you, who wants to see you make it with no ulterior motives, to support you with out being envious or to find someone who actually loves you and is not just someone loving you for there own selfish benefits. Let me tell you about someone special to me. They constantly push me to better myself, who want to see me succeed and someone who can love me without me worrying about the what if it’s. A romantic love you may ask? Why would that even matter?? Even if it was a friend or not.. If they love you as a friend first you’ll know that when you get to the point of “being more?they will be there for you, for the right reasons but if they aren’t your biggest fan as a friend I can guarantee a bumpy road when you both decide to take the next step. Be careful who you invest your time in. Not everyone you meet will have these qualities and blame it on a bad day, stress from outside sources, etc. Yes! People do have bad days because people suck sometimes! Do not ever let someone think it is okay to belittle you cause you can’t give them everything while you’re working on trying to be a better you. Too many people are in it for the wrong reason! Now let’s go back to that someone who is special to me. I can tell you for certain they are one of the most genuine, good hearted people I know!! You wouldn’t know it by there outer shell, they’re hard as a rock on the outer layer.. too many people have taken there kindness for a weakness. I can’t blame them for being that way. But Have you ever had someone stop what they’re doing because you were having a panic attack? Have you ever been struggling and needed someone at 1 in the morning and even though they were out of town they took your call and came to your place immediately because they knew you needed them? Have you ever been lucky enough to find someone to who loved you even when you didn’t love yourself or when you had nothing to offer? & yet they still seen the good in you?? Someone who would help you succeed? With planning for school or someone to walk your dog while your in class and they just did it because they knew you would be worried about not being able to take them out? Do you know what it’s like to see someone show up outside with food left over from there dinner or picked you up some fast food because they knew you haven’t eaten?? If you haven’t I’m sorry.. but I have and you should never settle for anything less when it comes to friends or lovers. Love doesn’t always need to be from a “relationship?if you looked around and couldn’t think of anyone who would do that for you.. it’s time to re-evaluate who you have in your life.. I’m such a lucky person!

110158	Happy	110158.jpg	Home is my happy place.A Reflective essay for Literature Nothing feels better than the satisfaction of being home. Although I’m currently living in Lapu-Lapu city, I was actually born on the urban lands of Cebu City. On my early years as a child we stayed on that house for about five years, yet with those lengthy five years I’ve never considered it as my home. Not gonna lie, my parents had their own humble beginnings to begin with, but with a third child coming close to birth my parents thought it might be a good time to transfer. A small plot of land was available on the streets of Canjulao, Lapu-Lapu city. They bought this small yet affordable plot of land and with that land a humble house was built. Throughout the years we’ve transformed this house and molded into what we consider today as our home. But what separates a home from a house? By definition a house is simply a building for human habitation, a structure inhabited by a family or small group of people. Home on the other hand is something different. I believe home is more than just a structure with four walls and a roof over head. Home is where your wifi connects automatically. Which 90% of my daily routine revolves around the use of the internet. Home is staying up late at night gaming because your siblings use up most of the internet speed by day. Home is randomly popping into your sisters?room blasting up music and joking around. Home is a breakfast meal from my mother, whenever she sees me still awake from an all nighter. It’s delicious and if you promised to do your chores she’d cook you something special. Home is where I can truly be myself or as what the users on Instagram call it “no filter? A place where I can be comfortable and be at ease without feeling anxious. These are just the simple things that make my home special. It may not seem like it’s perfect but it’s something I can claim as my own. The people you create memories with, the traditions you and your family make, the smell of home cooked dinner and the family heirlooms is what counts. This is the place where everyone becomes themselves. We’ve all come to grow and love our homes. From the happy days of our youthful days to the bumpy roads of growing as an adult. There’s no denying why we call it “Home sweet home? everyone finds pleasure or relief at being in or returning to one’s own home. It may sound cheesy but it’s true, Home is happiness, however you define it.

110193	Happy	110193.jpg	My manager at work is wondeful. She’s truly one of the nicest and best people I’ve ever met. I’ve been planning her daughters Quinceanera on the side and I was talking to her today about how I was sad her mother from Mexico couldn’t make it to the party because I’d love to meet her. So she whipped out her phone and called her mom and encouraged me to speak (I’ll admit, forced) to her mom in spanish. I was incredibly nervous about the whole thing but my manager knows how to nudge people out of their comfort zone so they’ll grow as people. It was wild. I told her mom that I love working with her daughter and her mom told me that it’s incredibly important to be a good person. She then had my manager give me a hug and told me if I ever needed to talk to somebody to call her. Then I asked of I could call her abuela and she said yes :? I’m so lucky.

112747	Happy	112747.jpg	Надо бы было сказать “Ден?города? но для меня это стал день открытий! Нет, я не открыла новый закон в физике и не узнала новейшие постулаты в музыке. Сегодня для меня открылись новые люди и новая деятельность. Без названий и имён просто скажу, что к некоторым людям имела не очень хорошее отношение. Почему? Не знаю точно, просто такой образ рисовался из мелких деталей. Вы знаете, это всё ерунда. Нужно постоянно понимать, что у человека чувства намного глубже, и вы сами не всегда угадаете и поймёте, почему он так поступает. Но его мотивы станут вам ясны, когда вы просто поговорите с этим человеком. Вот так вот! 🤓 А ещё сегодня у нас день города! Все празднуют, веселятся и радуются! Были интересные дефиле некоторых участников с необычными деталями. (Либо они танцевали, либо у них были крутые символы). И это забавляло. Сама прошла по площади три раза 😂 От колонны университета, с дядей от ТГК и потом ещё за пару секунд вступила в РЮЗ, и прошлась вместе с ними 😂 Невероятно, но факт: на дне города всегда была зрителем, а в этом году прошлась аж несколько раз 😂 Что ещё примечательного произошло? Я окончательно поняла, что люблю детей. 😪😇 Дело было так: мы зашли в одора, присели на скамеечке, чтобы немного отдохнуть. И тут рядом с нашей лавочкой ходила девочка. Она игралась и убегала от мамы (в шутку). Потом эта милашка увидела шарик у проходящих мимо детей и сказала маме, что тоже хочет шар. Но поблизости продавцов шариков не было и купить их было, соотвественно, негде. Что и сказала ей мама. Тогда она загрустила и отвернулась от мамы, чтобы она не видела её обиды и слёз 😔 В тот момент я поняла одну очень важную идею из давно моей любимой книги: “пок?живы улыбки детей, жив мир, в нём будет царить добро и счастье? Вроде бы банально и всё понятно. Чего тут неясного? Но когда именно осознаёшь это сам, без книг и подсказок - это стоит очень многого и дорогого. Я посмотрела на эту девочку и?Мне стало как-то не по себе. Я хотела бы посмотреть как она играется с мамой, как шутит, услышать её смех?А она просто грустит из-за шарика. По сути: ерунда же! Но для ребёнка это очень важно! 👧👦 И тут я вспомнила, что у меня в руке остался шарик, с которым я шла. Пока что он был со мной, и я его не выпустила в небо, что хотела и изначально планировала сделать. “?почему бы его не отдать?? - подумала я. Ведь для меня это просто шарик, а для ребёнка - целая радость! И недолго думая взяла и отдала. 🎈 Ремарка. Вот кто-то сейчас подумает: ?ой, написала про это, чтобы похвалили, какая молодец, что отдала шарик, фу? Знаете, мне всё равно. Что хотите, то и думайте. А я написала это для того, чтобы просто не забыть и помнить эту реакцию девочки. “Эт?мне? Ой, спасибо большое!? - задыхаясь от счастья сказала она. Вы бы только видели эти счастливые глаза! Она побежала к маме, рассказывать ей про шарик. Потом повернулась, ещё раз сказала “спасиб??и начала прыгать от счастья 😁 Мама была в шоке от радости ребёнка. Поблагодарив, они вместе с девочкой ушли домой. А мы дальше сидели на скамейке. И я думала про эту девочку?Как она радовалась, как сменились её эмоции на лице, когда она услышала про шарик. И как, оказывается, просто сделать детей счастливыми! Это очень удивило меня. А девочка запомнилась надолго. И так бы мне хотелось сделать с каждым ребёнком: просто подарить им немного радости. В конце концов так приятно смотреть, как они радуются! И хочется, чтобы никогда не грустили 🙃 А ещё, возможно, скоро изменится моя деятельность. Посмотрим, что будет. В какую сторону будут изменения не знаю пока даже сама. Но чувствую: будет что-то необычное 🌺 И про сон. Надеюсь, что он не сбудется. Так и останется в моей голове, как странное воображение и правдоподобное обстоятельство. Вновь всем спокойной ночи и сладких снов ✨? Совет: любите детей и не боготворите некоторых людей. Будьте внимательны. И не судите людей по отрывкам их поступков. Всегда узнавайте, что ими движет, чтобы понять окончательно, зачем они поступили так или иначе ☝️ А спонсор сегодняшнего дня - любимица диснеевских мультиков и просто рюзовская сова - Фатима 🦉 Мой личный билет и пропуск в мир РЮЗа и РДШ 😂

112828	Happy	112828.jpg	Самый дефицитный витамин. В2. 🍀🍀🍀🔥🍀🍀🍀 Ученые ФИЦ питания и биотехнологии провели обследование жителей России, чтобы оценить, как они обеспечены витаминами. Если раньше самым дефицитным был витамин С (аскорбиновая кислота), то теперь нам не хватает витаминов D, В2 и каротиноидов. Про витамин D. Каротиноиды это, строго говоря, не витамины, а предшественники витамина А. Они очень важны, и о них речь пойдет в следующий раз.А сейчас про самый настоящий и очень важный витамин В2. Цифра «2» в его названии говорит о том, что из витаминов группы В он был открыт вторым ?в 1920-м году. Но, строго говоря, открыли его на 40 лет раньше ?в 1880-м, и назвали лактофлавином. По-русски это значит «молочно-желтый»: у него желтый цвет, и выделили его из молочной сыворотки. Это вещество долго и считали пигментом, не подозревая о его пользе. Ничего странного в этом нет, ведь концепции витаминов в XIX веке ещё не было, а самый первый витамин В1 был открыт только в 1912-м, то есть, через 32 года после выделения лактофлавина. Потом это желтое вещество, ещё не зная точно его химическую формулу, обнаруживали в разных веществах и давали ему разные названия. Когда его нашли в яйцах, то в их честь называли овофлавином (ovo на латыни ?«яйцо»), потом, когда его обнаружили в печени, то назвали гептофлавином, а когда выделили из мочи, то придумали название урофлавин. Напрашивается шутка: не значит ли это, что моча может быть источником витамина В2? Нет. (at Planet Earth)

Whatever it takes to help them, or make them feel better, make them smile, I am always doing it for them. It’s just who I am, and I wouldn’t change it. I absolutely love doing it. ▪️ But sometimes I forget that I need to love myself too. I spend all this time helping other people, I miss the times I should be there for myself. ▪️ So today, I want all of my people to remember to love themselves. Take time for yourself. Do something to make yourself happy, and give the love that you’ve been handing out to everyone else, to yourself. ▪️ YOU DESERVE IT! thanks for posting this 💙 I needed it today!

É mais um ano, mais sabedoria, experiências diversas, risos, lágrimas, amor recebido e dado, amizade dividida. É mais um ano que tevi oportunidade de viver e por isso devo sentir gratidão. Guardo na memória tudo que foi bom, e aprendi com o que foi menos bom. Agora começa mais um ciclo, aproveitarei e desfrutarei dele da melhor forma que conseguir. 😊

That at the quantum level we are all connected- to everything- and everyone- even source. That our minds, souls or awareness- whatever you call it- is just source having a human experience.

113825	Happy	113825.jpg	Although most of my posts are positive and will continue to be! I love this! Posting positive stuff and sharing happiness hopefully makes other peoples day a little brighter and helps make me feel good at the same time! I’m a huge believer in law of attraction and I genuinely 99% of the time see the glass as half full, however I am human and I’ll be the first to admit that I’m certainly not a ray of sunshine 24 hours a day, sometimes I feel crappy, sad, angry, over emotional, groggy, lonely and that’s OK! So this is a reminder, we are only human and that means we all have a wide range of emotions, Own them feelings because they are real, pretending to be OK all the time can be exhausting and a hell of a lonely place, OWN THOSE FEELINGS you are not a robot, give yourself the permission to feel each and every emotion that pops up!! On that note I’m going to bed sulking because I’m full of a cold and being a parent to hormonal teenagers can sometimes suck!!

The attitude towards yourself, how you treat others through the services you render and how you deal with obstacles along your path. Attitude is the foundation that we build our lives upon. Keep that foundation solid and supportive to your elevation. Do not let people dictate your attitude. Keep your construction sight clear from those who seek to sabotage or destroy through pessimistic behaviors. You have a life to create and structure. Watch your foundation, the attitude. Believe the Champion in You! -Yogesh Sharma (at Jakarta)

117266	Happy	117266.jpg	i remember at the beginning of our relationship, i wasn’t comfortable showing our funny faces, double-chins, and all the imperfections that you can think of. being with him for almost 3 years now, i just don’t care anymore about the perfect couple selfie…this is us ❤️ i remember he told me a long time ago that he said that he likes this picture a lot because it compliments who we are as a couple. the real imperfections of ourselves. i was looking back at my camera roll and realize that we haven’t taken a picture of us in a long time and if we did, he would always make a silly face or refuse to take a selfie with me haha the picture above is our selfie together at the very beginning of our relationship (2015) and i told myself i will never post it. i guess what i’m trying to reflect is that i am very happy to be with him. happy to be comfortable in my own skin. happy to be silly with him. happy to show my imperfections. looks will fade but our soul and our love is what keeps us alive.

118913	Happy	118913.jpg	As this year comes to an end, I’m happy to say I have changed. My views, my attitude and my own well being. The beginning of 2018 was not to shiny but it was where my strength and faith was tested. I went through hardships and a lot of negativity in my world. Sometimes thinking there’s only one way out. I had to endure what I had to endure in order to build myself differently. I for once have put faith back into my own life again. With that, it gave me opportunities of a lifetime. I still have much to cross out but I am getting back to my roots and seeing the world a lot more different. This year will be a different way to look at life now and an opportunity to do things different. I’m not going to say new year new me, it’s going to be new year same old me! Lol (sorta) l (at Park MGM)

I truly believe that living with Type 1 Diabetes and all its challenges day in day out, you couldn’t be anything else other than a WARRIOR!!!! I truly believe when you have to mentally and physically balance your life the way a person living with Type 1 Diabetes does on a daily basis, you learn not to sweat the small stuff, and only worry about the important stuff, like friends and family. So soldier on my warriors 💕🧡🧡🧡 www.diabetesalive.org.au

121342	Happy	121342.jpg	Hola ihr Lieben! Das auf dem Bild sind wir vor einem ziemlich großen Haus. Auch wenn wir uns gerade mit 11 weiteren Personen ein Haus teilen und man denken könnte, dass wir in dieser großen Hütte (welche übrigens die ehemalige Finca der Kandidatinnen von war) schlafen, waren wir dort heute bloß für eine Veranstaltung. Unsere Unterkunft ist aber auch ziemlich groß und mit so vielen Menschen zusammenzuleben sehr interessant, schön und anstrengend zugleich. Das letzte Mal als wir uns mit neun lieben Menschen zuletzt die Wohnung geteilt hatten, war in Melbourne und obwohl es nicht immer einfach ist, finden wir das Leben in einer Gemeinschaft einfach unglaublich erfüllend und inspirierend. Lebt ihr in einer WG oder seid ihr eher wie der Kevin allein daheim? Achja, schönes Wochenende was auch immer ihr heute vorhabt, enjoy it. ___________________________________________________________ (hier: Mallorca)

Expect any invite offers for event, you will be properly acknowledged and even honored for a skill, talent, or accomplishment. Your big heart will also be appreciated. Could be some sort of public, work or family reward is possible, if only in the form of praise, which can be transformational something more tangible later. If not seeking validation or kudos, be on the alert because it’s coming. You’ve earned it 😇 😇 haha

There are so many wildflowers and herbs that have waited an entire year to stretch and blossom and people just mow them over without a single care.✨I was just admiring the wildflowers in my neighbors lawn and moments later I see him mowing over them, it made me so sad. So I said a prayer for all the flowers that never have the chance to blossom or warm their faces to the sun for long. Also made me think of all the other silly things we do for no other reason except “everyone else is doing it?I say stay wild and let the wild be wild.🍓This is my backyard and I think it’s beautiful just the way it is.🌿🍄

This evergreen beauties with needle-like leaves and blue berries live all over the planet from the Arctic, to the tropical Africa, America, almost all over Europe and in the mountains of the Himalayas. Juniper is a typical mountain plant, and the highest-known Juniper forest lives in the northern Himalayas, creating one of the highest tree-lines on earth. In most species, the berries are aromatic and can be used as a spice, and herb. So even if the leaves of junipers are hard and sharp, that makes handpicking a hard job, people use this aromatic berries people make alcoholic tinctures, Gin, and other Strong medicines. As a herb it relieves rheumatic and joint pains, helps to balance high blood pressure, heart failure, gynecological problems. Stimulate appetite, and helps to dissolve kidney and gallstone. This amazing tree we collected in the Northern Hillside of Hungary. The wood is coming from a fallen aged tree, we didn’t cut it out. (Trees are our oxygen sources, so they deserve the highest respect, and we treat them as they are, a breathable living being). The wood of a juniper is dry, strong, resinous and oily and when its fresh it has a fantastic smell. Every piece is handpicked, carefully selected and sliced juniper wood with in-burned ancient symbols. They are approximately 4cm in diameter. The rope is 80-85cm long, waxed necklace strap. You can easily adjust to your size by cutting it shorter. burn the endings after you adjusted to the proper size). 🌿Vpdrums; Inspired by Nature, made with Love

124534	Happy	124534.jpg	Back-to-back catchup with friends. Love is in the air—or the want for it. Even the priest talked about the proof and qualities of true love. Dear heart, how are you? 💕 I trust that God will write my love story. Maybe not as I imagined, but in His own beautiful way. For now, may God’s perfect love flow through the voids of my soul. May His perfect love be my guide in loving myself, for I cannot give the love that I do not have. Only then will I have love to surrender fully and unconditionally. “It is not how much we do, but how much love we put in the doing. It is not how much we give, but how much love is put in the giving.?Mother Teresa ? ☀? Year2

124764	Happy	124764.jpg	What does it mean to focus on our happiness?⠀ ⠀ Does that mean being happy 24/7? No, not at all. ⠀ Does it mean being a total Pollyanna about life? Maybe, when need. ⠀ ⠀ I think that focusing on happiness means that you think about it, focus your time + energy on it and take action and do things that add more happiness to your life. ⠀ ⠀ I’m not happy all the time. Honestly, I’m not even always as happy as I’d like to be. ⠀ ⠀ But I know what I’m working towards. I know the level of happiness that I’m dreaming of and I take a little step every day to move me closer to that. PS. sometimes, that step is giving myself the love and space to have a bad moment or feel sad for a little while. ⠀ ⠀ It’s impossible to be happy 24/7. Contrast is what life is all about. If we didn’t have sadness, we wouldn’t recognize what happiness is. If we didn’t have the tough moments, we wouldn’t be able to fully relish the good ones. ⠀ ⠀ The key here is focus. ⠀ ⠀ What are you focusing on: good or bad, happy or sad, positive or negative? ⠀ ⠀ They all serve a purpose, but focusing on the bad, sad and negative absolutely does not. There is no reason to dwell on the less-than-stellar things that have happened. ⠀ ⠀ Shift your thinking from one of being sad or negative to an easy-to-achieve positive emotion. We often can’t move from sad ?happy right away. But we can move from sad or negative to hopeful that the future will be better. We can move from sad or negative to optimistic that things will be different later, tomorrow or 5 minutes from now. ⠀ ⠀ It’s all about taking control of your mind and using it to your advantage instead of letting it use you. Focus on the good so that you can attract more of it into your life. ⠀ ⠀ If you want a little help getting happier right now, check the link in my bio for a free Happiness Meditation I created just for you! 💕🔝⠀ ⠀ (at Lucca, Italy)

126515	Happy	126515.jpg	I though I had to be Miss Misery to write songs. Turns out I was wrong and this was probably self-destructive. The last few months have been tinted by a layer of grey, every activity a bit of a blur, fading into monotony. Consequently my creativity belly flopped onto a cactus farm and my note book is full of half finished songs. The last week the sun has been shining and the blossom in the park is blooming and suddenly beauty is reappearing and guess what just knocked on the door - a new song - one that I actually finished and like. It’s not a happy song though - some things never change. ;)

127681	Happy	127681.jpg	New Post has been published on Synesthesia Synesthesia is a neurological phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway. In one of the more common forms of Synesthesia, a person will see flashes of color when they hear certain sounds or one of their other senses is triggered. I’ve been told that I have a different way of viewing the world (I mean, we all do), but, being of a more artistic mind, I sometimes see the world in very different colors, and I truly think that it comes through in my graphic design. While I don’t have Synesthesia, when I edit a photo, sometimes I feel like I do. Especially when I am listening to the score of a movie and I decide that the image I am working on is either going to look like a painting or a panel from a comic book. This particular edit was inspired by Adam Young’s score “The Spirit of St Louis.? -JM

I go to the omelet station and ask them to sauté all the veggies they have in olive oil and have that over toast?Coffee w a little bit of soy milk and a vegan cinnamon bun that I also brought from home (thanks mom)🙈🐰 My next plate was a big salad w artichoke, olives, greens, corn, tomato and hummus on the side. Oh, and mimosas. Mimosas are vegan! And that might just be the most important thing💁🏼‍♀️? Thanks and team for a fun brunch and Happy Easter everyone!

128516	Happy	128516.jpg	🌸꽂길(Flower Road)~ Big Bang🎵 🍃La verdad estoy frustrada y quizás hasta enojada conmigo misma pero por algo pasan las cosas, creo que el mundo entero sabe cuan amo lo que hago, y cuanto lo deseo. Encontrar algo que amas a pesar de mil cosas es super difícil, mas para mi. Hoy ya con un tiempo sin hacerlo (para mi eterno) y quizás hasta cuando sin poder practicar y seguir avanzando en esto. Aquella lesión que no sentí en su momento me limita no tan solo en pole, sino que también en mi trabajo?y hasta universidad. ¿Que mas puedo hacer aparte de descansar? Y descansar entre comillas. El pole me ha ayudado a tantas cosas que hoy de verdad solo quiero llorar, pero no puedo. Es frustrante que te digan que no tienes nada o que no saben lo que es y tampoco como tratarte correctamente, primera vez que la hiperlaxitud me juega en contra jamas me había pasado, al contrario, con orgullo decia que soy hiperlaxa, aun lo digo pero a la vez con dolor. Me queda tiempo aun para que me vean y me traten y si quisiera tratarme donde debo, tendría que poner mucho dinero en ello lo cual no tengo en este momento. Que debo hacer? Que debería hacer? Solo quiero recuperarme, mover mi hombro, poder dormir sin dolor ni molestia, también quiero recuperarme de mis lesiones en las piernas que como dije; tampoco saben lo que tengo ni como tratarme. Acaso no entienden que por lo que pido ayuda es para continuar en lo que amo y no tan solo para poder caminar o poder llevar algo con ambos brazos. Solo queda esperar, creo?estoy llena de colapso y cosas que solo el pole me quitaba. Ahora solo me las aguanto y si lo escribo es por desahogo me da lo mismo quien lo lea. Si encuentran algo que aman; luchen por ello, cuidense y no lo dejen a pesar de todo. Nunca sonrio en las fotos pero se puede ver lo feliz que estaba por tan solo un momento. Si, esa es mi sonrisa de verdad.

I work with some amazing people, fantastic teachers and the best boss ever, myself!

128681	Happy	128681.jpg	XIII Death Death is the law of impermanence. All things must end. Accept it. Death can occur by a natural, evolutionary shedding (snake shedding its skin), letting go (Snake River letting its waters flow out) or release (falling leaf). As symbolized by the knife-like nose beak of the Scorpio-looking New Guinea spirit mask, death may be consciously invited by a cutting away of what is dead, stagnant or oppressive. Death may sadden you (the sculpture “Melancholia?, but ultimately it is liberating. Death is a transformation which brings freedom and is symbolized by the open space, fresh air and empty silence of the Dead Sea. Be aware that you are being devoured by forces greater than yourself and acknowledge the ever-present Spector of death, which is symbolized by the looming spirit mask and the crayfish being eaten by the heron. Knowing that every moment may be your last forces you to live fully in the moment. The shadow or negative side of Death: To fear death is not to live. You cannot live unless you are willing to die. Only by letting go can you allow life in. Otherwise, you are stiff, rigid and uptight ?really dead. (at Galveston County, Texas)

129075	Happy	129075.jpg	3. Compliment everyone you see for an entire day. On Monday the 19th of a March 2018, the task I tackled was complimenting everyone I saw that day. The concept I extracted from my last task was happiness. So I tried to spread happiness by complimenting everyone. I went out of my way to specifically compliment everyone, even if I didn’t know them. While the people in these images, for the most part, look pretty natural, the majority of people I complimented were quite happy after I complimented them, if not a bit shocked as well. I found it very interesting to see how different people reacted to my compliments. Reactions ranged from confused to happiness to everything in between. Through this task I learnt that some people don’t know how to handle it when someone compliments them. A lot of people laughed it off or felt very awkward about it. The concept I am extracting from this task is confidence because I believe it requires a certain level of self confidence to be able to accept a compliment. I also felt that I showed confidence by going up to everyone I saw and complimenting them especially when it came to complementing someone I had never met before.

130346	Happy	130346.jpg	This used to be a peely old rusty chair. Not wanting to throw away a sturdy chair, I sanded, rubbed, chipped away the old wood, rust treated it and made it into a chair. I used acrylic gloss then craft acrylic and pink, green, yellow and blue and of course my new favourite The legs are tissue paper decoupaged then all over finished with yacht varnish (it’s a greenhouse chair). The advice from was that the varnish will kill the effects of the black, BUT I think that while it has obviously lost the matt finish, the black still looks absolutely incredible. Better than when I acrylic varnished a plaque.

130724	Happy	130724.jpg	Hi all! I’ve been doing pretty good with being consistent with my workouts. I’ve been slacking on BBG a bit and only doing two out of three of the weekly workouts the last two weeks. However, I’m really LOVING my treadmill. I put it on a 7.5% incline to work my body a bit harder. It feels so wonderful when I step off the treadmill. So while I’ve decreased BBG a bit, I’ve definitely increased my treadmill use. Honestly, I’m totally fine with that and it’s because I genuinely love and enjoy it. It’s so hard to find ways for me to exercise that I find truly enjoyable. And if this is the only way for my to really stay consistent in working out 4-5 times a week, then I’ll do it! ☺️

She has been up, she has been down, she quit and started again but NOW she is on fire!!!!!! I have known Megan for 13 years now, she used to babysit my kids. I saw her gaining weight and it broke my heart. The struggle is real. She’s been through so much. I’m glad I could help support her in some ways. She is strong, she is determined, I’M SO PROUD OF HER! Megan shares her journey but she never told you she’s a Beachbody coach and she could help you. If I can’t inspire you I hope she can.

134493	Happy	134493.jpg	Ангелы приходят в этот мир, чтобы измененить его к лучшему и поделиться своим светом. Они не понимают современный мир. Почему мы тратим всё своё время на ненавистную работу, чтобы позволить себе вещи, которые нам не нужны?! Почему мы уничтожаем нашу планету, которая является нашим единственным домом? Почему мы убиваем себя и других? Почему мы люди ведём себя хуже зверей? Работников света постоянно преследуют эти вопросы, но ответы на них не утешают. Земные ангелы просто знают, что забота о планете и друг друге ?это и есть счастливая жизнь. :-) (Luck, Ukraine)

134887	Happy	134887.jpg	“Hello World!! My name is Randi Fisk and this is my Thrive Experience. Let me tell you, I am beyond grateful these 3 simple steps (capsules, Lifestyle Mix, DFT) came into my life. When I say Thrive has changed my life I mean that with all my heart. I have some health challenges that negatively affect me, but I finally have my life back! Let me explain a little below. (: Before Thrive: Exhausted, nonfunctioning, couch potato, slacking housekeeper, insecure, unhappy, unmotivated mess. I was struggling. After Thrive: Awake, happy, functioning, fun, active mom, better wife, gets the laundry and housework done, cooks dinner instead of going out or ordering in, living life to the absolute fullest and loving every minute of it. I am so glad I decided to take the leap and give the 3 steps a try. I am a Thriver for life. 🖤🖤?

It takes place over the course of twenty-four hours. There are four main characters. There is a world. Side characters exist. Parents do not. The world is two-dimensional, and may or may not be fake. Side effects include: memory loss and insanity. Treatment includes: sleep and return of sanity. There are beliefs, which are deluded. There are eyes, which are awake. There are emotions. There is love.

But with trust, understanding and communication, together it conquers. Talk through misunderstandings, listen to what each other heart has to say and learn to love and forgive again. Living the present, looking forward to the future without regrets of the past ❤|

136026	Love	136026.jpg	Grand Love 💘 Today’s love is aged and old, just like the interesting stories you were once told. It’s like the old wine that keeps getting better with time. It’s like the antiques we all have. Some consider it timeless beauty while others an inconvenience of the past. However, we all agree that we are what we are because of our history. We learn from things done before us in time and build our present where the previous one left of. As a kid, I would visit my grandfather. He was probably the first jolly old man I had seen. So unlikely of his age. But always very energetic and pampering. I starkly remember arm wrestling with him and he would make me believe that I gave him a tough fight. Even though he was from the defence background, he didn’t mind losing from a kid like me. And whenever I used to leave, he would ensure I get a huge cube of sugar to chew on. A simple, middle-class solution to cure the bitterness of departing. 🥰 If that’s not what love is, then what is? ❣️ Just like the old wine, the memories of our grandparents only get better with time. We come to understand so many things they said or did. Not everything might be justified but it’s understood, with time. And that’s important. Gradually our parents too enter that stage and sooner or later we will too. Will our hearts be equally jolly? 🤔 There are million things that grandparents can teach us. But there’s much more we can learn ourselves if only we took time out to spend with them. They need the love, and you need their loving gaze. Somehow in the little time you’re gonna have together, you’ll learn to love in 10,000 more ways. So don’t waste your days. If you don’t have your elderly around, there are so many homes where they don’t have their children too. You can visit and just be there for a moment or two. The smile you bring is going to help them live with happy memories and in the bargain you would have earned loads of blessings for you. So, spend time with the elderly wherever you get a chance. Happy Loving to You!♥️👴👵

136754	Love	136754.jpg	Не смей быть меньше, чем ты можешь быть. 🌸🌸🌸💝🌸🌸🌸 Слушай меня. Прямо сейчас. Тебя не слишком много. Тебя никогда не было много. Тебя никогда не будет много. Одна эта идея абсурдна. Потому что ты родилась, чтобы быть собой. Все мы. Без малейшего исключения. Все вы пришли в этот мир, чтобы быть самыми пульсирующими-кровоточащими-любящими-плачущими-чувствующими созданиями. И если кто-то говорит тебе, что ты слишком, то вот единственная правда, которую тебе нужно запомнить: высоковероятно, что эти люди ни сейчас, никогда в жизни не будут достаточны для тебя. Потому что ты, моя девочка, ты ?солнце, и луна, и звезды. Ты ?сила, которая управляет приливом и отливом. Ты ?несдерживаемый вой при полной луне. Ты ?эссенция экстатического танца. Ты ?жар и секс, и пот и огонь, и мягкость и мужество, и блаженство и океан слёз. Ты ?во всём. Ты ?мать всех нас и дочь вселенной. Ты проходишь через тени и свет. Ты сгораешь и возрождаешься снова, держа руку на пульсе мира. Ты заставляешь богов трепетать. И это, моя дорогая, ?граница, которую ты переступаешь и многим людям становится от этого безумно неудобно. Это заставляет их отпрыгнуть и оттолкнуть тебя. Потому что то, как ты танцуешь со своей тенью и твоё непоколебимое принятие своей яркости заставляет их соприкоснуться с необыкновенным пространством, которое восхищает их и ужасает одновременно. Одно твоё существование заставляет их сделать шаг в место, которое они не готовы увидеть. Потому что, как глубины океана зовут тебя домой, ты никогда не будешь простой. Но, дорогая, ты появилась не для того, чтобы быть простой. Ты здесь для гораздо большего. Потому что ты ?разрушительница границ. Ты ?искательница правды. Ты ?искушение, и соблазн, и жар. Ты ?зеркало и колдунья, и внутри тебя водоворот силы тысячелетий. Так что нет, ты не простая.👇👇👇 (at Planet Earth)

138701	Love	138701.jpg	Only those who are exceptionally blessed can know this feeling. It is that feeling that comes when you feel the touch of someone that your heart beats for and it makes your heart race as much as it calms your soul and brings you rest. It is when you find true love, the kind of love that gives without motive, that is selfless and not selfish, and that you never have to second guess their loyalty or commitment? This is true love realized. The alarms of another human being that makes you feel completely at home and safe.

I had only $50 to my name. Luckily, Ismriti Devi 💜 Eva at Dharma yoga Center let me stay there and work. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻That saved me and I got to take a lot of classes with Sri Dharma Mittra. What a miracle. Before that I was very worried, and I went to see my friend Paul McMahon in Woodstock. I asked him what I should do since I have no money and no job. He said, “you should be poor for a while? 😂 His words helped me. Especially since he was raising two little girls and also did not have any money. I never forgot that. The richest human is generous of spirit! And not afraid to lose and love.

138851	Love	138851.jpg	Happy Diwali everybody!! In Hinduism Diwali is known as the Festival of Lights: There are many legends about Diwali - Mother Lakshmi’s Birthday, Mother Lakshmi and Lord Vishnu’s marriage, Lord Ram with Sita & Lakshman coming back from his 14 year exile after vanquishing the demon king Ravana. Lord Ganesh is also worshipped during Diwali because He is the symbol of auspiciousness and wisdom. Mother Kali is also worshipped. She is the dark Goddess of strength. Diwali is about good over evil, Light over darkness, etc. During each Diwali we illuminate our hearts & homes, This light empowers us to do good deeds. Hindus believe that the light of lights is the one that steadily shines in the chamber of the heart. We try to forgive each other during this time and look to each other with love in our hearts & minds. May this New Year bring us everything we want and so much more. I wish everybody Peace, prosperity, health and joy 💙 My life is still taking shape in many ways. I feel blessed to be here. Thank u to everybody in my life. I pray that many blessings continue to be showered on all of us. I Love all of u ❤️💙🙏🕉 🎉🎊

And the more practice u get at it the better u will be at shifting the conversation to the things u are interested in. One good conversation on the phone or thru text can have u on a woman’s mind for days! So listening to the things she says and asking the right questions to keep the convo flowing is priceless! And that’s one way to become successful with women. ↗️ Turn on your post notifications!! Tag someone that would like my page or the things I talk about!

139510	Love	139510.jpg	“Christian love bears evil, but it does not tolerate it. It does penance for the sins of others, but it is not broadminded about sin. The cry for tolerance never induces it to quench its hatred of the evil philosophies that have entered into contest with the Truth. It forgives the sinner, and it hates the sin; it is unmerciful to the error in his mind. The sinner it will always take back into the bosom of the Mystical Body; but his lie will never be taken into the treasury of His Wisdom. Real love involves real hatred: whoever has lost the power of moral indignation and the urge to drive the buyers and sellers from the temples has also lost a living, fervent love of Truth. Charity, then, is not a mild philosophy of “live and let live? it is not a species of sloppy sentiment. Charity is the infusion of the Spirit of God, which makes us love the beautiful and hate the morally ugly.?- Fulton Sheen

140034	Love	140034.jpg	There’s this famous quote from Winnie the Pooh that best friends like to quote that says “If you live to be a hundred, I want to live to be a hundred minus one day so I never have to live without you.? I always loved the concept of someone loving me so much that they couldn’t stand to see a world without me in it. In March, my grandma died. She was one of my favorite people in the world and losing her devastated me. After the funeral, as I stood by my grandma’s casket at the cemetery, my best friend wrapped her arms around me and said “I hope you die before me.?My only reaction was to laugh and slap her arm. I told her that that’s not the way the quote goes and she was supposed to say she hopes she dies before me because it would hurt her too much to live without me. However, she was insistent that she hoped I died before her. I have to admit, I was a little hurt. I didn’t understand why she’d say that and it bothered me long after we’d left the cemetery. A week or two later I brought what she’d said back up. I joked that all people lovingly tell their best friends “I hope I die before you because I don’t want to live without you,?and then there’s her who just says “I hope you die before me.?We laughed about it but then she explained what she’d meant by that. She told me that she had seen all of the pain and heartbreak that I had gone through with losing my grandma and she never wanted me to have to feel pain like that again. She wanted me to die before her so that she would experience the sadness and heartbreak that comes with losing someone you deeply love so that I didn’t have to. And so now, even though I joke about how terrible it sounds that she wants me to die before her, I hold it as the kindness, most compassionate thing anyone has ever said to me.

140428	Love	140428.jpg	Rilke on the Tremendous Tasks of Solitude and Love At thirty-one, Nietzsche would say, I am, in the sense of “high culture? still only child. Indeed, I admit that I have only a nascent consciousness of my phantasm: I am so far from developing a sense of immanence for enduring solitude and, even more importantly, a sense of immanence for loving and being loved by another human being, and I cannot effectively embody my phantasm without a sense of immanence for these two tremendous tasks. Whenever I find myself daunted by how difficult it is to affectively prepare for and effectively perform the tremendous tasks of solitude and love, I return, again and again, to some words that Rilke when he was about the age I am now: Most people have (with the help of conventions) turned their solutions toward what is easy and toward the easiest side of the easy; but it is clear that we must trust in what is difficult; everything alive trusts in it, everything in Nature grows and defends itself any way it can and is spontaneously itself, tries to be itself at all costs and against all opposition. We know little, but that we must trust in what is difficult is a certainty that will never abandon us; it is good to be solitary, for solitude is difficult; that something is difficult must be one more reason for us to do it. It is also good to love: because love is difficult. For one human being to love another human being: that is perhaps the most difficult task that has been entrusted to us, the ultimate task, the final test and proof, the work for which all other work is merely preparation. Loving does not at first mean merging, surrendering, and uniting with another person (for what would a union be of two people who are unclarified, unfinished, and still incoherent?), it is a high inducement for the individual to ripen, to become something in himself, to become a world, to become a world in himself for the sake of another person; it is a great, demanding claim on him, something that chooses him and calls him to vast distances. Only in this sense, as the task of working on themselves (“to hearken and to hammer day and night?, may young people use the love that is given to them. Merging and surrendering and every kind of communion is not for the [young] (who must still, for a long, long time, save and gather themselves); it is the ultimate, is perhaps that for which human lives are as yet barely large enough. […] Whoever looks seriously will find that neither for death, which is difficult, nor for difficult love has any clarification, any solution, any hint of a path been perceived; and for both these tasks, which we carry wrapped up and hand, on without opening, there is no general, agreed-upon rule that can be discovered. But in the same measure in which we begin to test life as individuals, these great Things will come to meet us, the individuals, with greater intimacy. The claims that the difficult work of love makes upon our development are greater than life, and we, as beginners, are not equal to them. But if we nevertheless endure and take this love upon us as burden and apprenticeship, instead of losing ourselves in the whole easy and frivolous game behind which people have hidden from the most solemn solemnity of their being, then a small advance and a lightening will perhaps be perceptible to those who come long after us. That would be much.

140971	Love	140971.jpg	Pour love and respect wherever you go, even if you do not receive the same Great transformations only happen with small interferences multiplied. In Israel the deserts are overcome by fertility through drop irrigation. One drop of water per minute at the foot of the plant. And enough for it to grow and produce fruit. Let us do the same. Rather than motivate the dispute, promote collaboration in your work environment. With friends, family, and those who cross your path, offer what you hold most sacred: your ability to love and reconcile those who are divided. Fr Fabio de Melo.

Being in love is the most wonderful thing in this world. But it can be so devastating as well. I am in the stage of being confused whether to continue or not. Should I continue to pursue this person eventhough chances are i might break my heart again? Or i might as well stop because it is not worth fighting for?

MADAME HEPBURN is out for a nice causal drive in her sports car 🚗 looking at the leaves 🍁 as they start changing color this fall. How refreshing? Having her vintage dangling rectangular earrings blowing 💨in the wind, being footloose and fancy free, she doesn’t have a care in the world and nobody to answer to. Butterflies are free and so is she. How wonderful? MADAME HEPBURN is having her own quiet time and yet still wants to look fashionable just in case a suitor shall cross her path? It’s best to be prepared because you never know when you might run into Mr. Right 👍or worst Mr. Wrong, 👎and if the later happens, she will step 👠on the gas ⛽️ and drive 🚗 💨away fast. So what will you being wearing fall? It’s going to be Thanksgiving 🦃 soon and you want to look your best for the holidays and fantaisie bijoux from PARIS makes women happy. Exceptional fantaisie bijoux from PARIS is available at HOUSE of FISHER to make you feel wonderful for the upcoming holidays and everyday too.

142872	Love	142872.jpg	CELESTIAL CHURCH OF CHRIST; A TRUE BODY OF CHRIST. In 1947, God gave birth to this beautiful Church (CCC) through His eminence Pa SBJ Oshoffa. The foundation of the church was so strong with much faith of love for one another (1st Corinthians 13). We preach gospel with much love and miracles still happening day and night. There are some people who look like us but they are not part of us( Neither by putting on our garments to deceive people in the community). WEINTHECCC is using this medium to welcome more people into the kingdom of God in Celestial Church of Christ and you will be saved through the love of Christ. Extract from Note.

That look of exhaustion turned to delight upon seeing my preparations of fresh vegetables, washed tenderly and placed on a towel. What a salad this will be. Two polished wine glasses sat next to the breathing bottle of opened Merlot, the cork serving as a reminder of my attentiveness. A selection of cheeses has been curated, some sliced, cold fruit complimented it all to usher in a wonderful dinner from the heated grill to come. A smile broke across her face, probably for the first one for the day. “Dinner my Love?? ~Robin 👉Lovers in the Woods - a romance novel due out in December. For more, visit ➡️ RobinAustinReed.com ⬅️

143902	Love	143902.jpg	Elogio alla lentezza. Non mi trovo sulle sponde del laghetto del parco Cillarese della mia città, ma uso questa foto per elogiare i tempi lenti della natura. L'ho scattata in una delle mie amate corse all'aria aperta e, in effetti, sono andata velocissima in questo periodo?Ma la natura e le sue leggi del ciclo della vita si sono imposte. Non mi ero mai fermata per così tanto tempo senza fremere da quando ho deciso di dedicare il mio tempo libero (e anche quello non libero), i miei risparmi (e i miei guadagni), il mio ottimismo (e qualche scazzo), le mie energie (e pure la mia stanchezza) a questo sogno dal cappello fucsia. E da questo sogno sono nate cose stupende in termini di nuovi progetti collegati, in termini di rapporti professionali che sono diventati bellissime esperienze umane, in termini di autostima nello scoprire talenti e carattere che non sapevo neanche di avere?Ora, peró, elogio la lentezza perché ci vuole il giusto tempo e il giusto ritmo per affrontare dei cambiamenti, degli addii e delle rinascite. La lentezza della natura sta maturando nuovi percorsi e nuovi progetti?Lenti ma mai fermi e a me sono mancati tanto i pensierini della sera per Vieni a viaggiare in Puglia. (presso Brindisi, Italy)

They want rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters. This struggle may be a moral one; or it may be a physical one; or it may be both moral and physical; but it must be a struggle. Frederick Douglass 💎👑 (presso Talbot County, Georgia)

Your mind is empty as you just focus on the person you walk to when you step into a church, a hall or a route to the outdoor wedding venue. Just before the start of ceremony, feeling became so complicated which you cannot explain it clearly - a mixture of joy and a bit of ‘sadness? as you are leaving the family behind, leaving the first man who stood behind your back all the time since you first met him when you were born. The one who gives you unconditional - Dad. To children, father means a strong icon, a person who supports. After all these years, it is time to give the girl to another man. Father gently put his daughter’s hand on this guy’s hand with hope and trust, 'Take my daughter’s hand and always be with her.?You smile, but there is tear rolling down because of this mixed feeling of joy and 'sadness? We are honored to be able to witness these moments over and over again with our cameras. 婚姻從尋找生命中的愛和幸福開始? 一個男人來偷走你的心。他愛你，令你在一次又一次地愛上了他。你開始想像結婚後生活將會如何。你開始計劃每一個細節，比如選擇婚紗，取吉日。在他求婚之後，是時候讓夢想成真了！ 在婚禮當天，你會再次興奮起來。當你走進教堂，大廳或去戶外婚禮場地的路上時，你只關注你走向的人，你的思緒是空虛的。就在儀式開始之前，感覺變得如此復雜，你無法清楚地解釋它 - 一種喜悅和一?悲傷'的混合。你將離開家庭，離開由你出生時便遇上，第一個站在你背後的男人。給你無條件愛的?- 爸爸? 對孩子來說，父親意味著一個強大的支柱。經過這麼多年，終於是時候把女孩送給另一個男人了。父親帶著希望和信任輕輕地把女兒的手放在這個人的手上，“緊抓住我女兒的手，永遠和她在一起。?你微笑著，但因為這種喜憂參與的混合感，淚水滾滾而來。我們很榮幸能夠用我們的相機一遍又一遍地見證這些感人時刻?

Not only that, I didn’t have any other first cousins born after me until my little cousin was born 10 years after me, so she has always been very special to me. Yesterday I got to celebrate with her and the rest of our family in welcoming her new husband Devin to our family. Collage 1 is a selection of scenes from the ceremony and reception; 2. Dad getting Olivia a drink, Darren with his boys Max and Ben, my aunt Anita and Uncle Doug dancing, all of the Lewis “kids?together (Anita, Doug, Don, mom); 3. Dad, Dylan, Uncle Gordie, and Uncle Don, Sam and Me, Me and Aunty Anita, Me and my sister Brittany, my nephew Liam having a snooze under the table; 4. Adrien and I, Aunty Anita and Devin, Aunty JoAnne, Aunty Anita, me, Tanya, mom, (the boots are Liams), KyLynn, Tanya, Dale, and Aunty Anita all sharing a laugh. It was so good to see everyone and I can’t wait to do it all again in May back in Saskatoon 😉 you’re a great bunch and you make me proud to be a Lewis ?

Our 3rd donation was to the Ronald McDonald House Charities of San Diego (RMHC). ?Mandy gave us a tour of RMHC and explained what they do for families with sick children. RMHC is quite a compassionate place for families in need. ?The lengths RMHC goes to to help parents cope with sick children, help take care of the siblings that are well; in order to keep the family together. As an example, a child was life-flighted in from Hawaii where there wasn’t a hospital that had what that child required to survive. ?Some family members come to the RMHC with what they have on their backs in emergency situations. RMHC provides clothing, housing, 150 meals for breakfast, 150 meals for lunch and 150 meals for dinner, every single day. ❤These meals are all donated and not just for the residents of the 55 rooms that are housed there, but for all families on their waiting list who have sick kids at different hospitals across San Diego and have nowhere to stay. ?They provide meals to these wait-listed families along with shower facilities and rooms to take naps. Some families are living in their cars to be close to their children. ❤The pictures I’ve posted show: a beautiful comfortable lobby area, a dining room with fresh donated flowers for each table arranged by volunteers, a massive modern stainless steel kitchen recently built with a $3.2M dollar donation, which includes small individual refrigerators for each family, a school room that teaches K-12 for the well siblings living at RMHC, a workout room, laundry facilities, non-denominational chapel, a beauty salon, and a reading/play room donated by the San Diego Padres. ?Kids under 12 are not allowed during flu season to visit a sibling at Rady so RMHC came up with a solution. ?A room with windows floor/ceiling, faces the Rady Hospital that also has a windowed floor/ceiling room. That way siblings can see and wave at each other. ❤They have thought of everything so families in distress don’t have to think of anything. Please keep this charity in mind when thinking of a charitable donation or volunteering your time?

146410	Love	146410.jpg	FEBRUARY 12th 2006 To my Dear love Larry Honn. Happy Anniversary! 13 years ago today we set to commit our lives to each other. We have built a family and our love, friendship and partnership has made us grow both as people and parents. You truly have been a rock for me, especially during my deepest lows,most recently the passing of my mother. You are a beacon in my life and I truly feel blessed to call you my husband. I look back as you do and I can’t believe we have been in this life adventure together for more than 13 years not counting the 3 years of dating. Each day I love you more and I will love you forever and ever and to the next realm! Your wife❤️ (at The Sky Room)

146443	Love	146443.jpg	Live every moment as if it were you last. I LOVE being horribly straightforward?I love sending reckless text messages (because how reckless can a form of digitized communication be?) and telling people that I love them and how they are absolutely magical humans that I cannot believe they really exist. I Love saying “kiss me harder,?and “your an amazing person,?and “you brighten my day.?This starts and ends with my kids. Obviously I’m nothing close to perfect, but I try to live my life as straight-forward as possible. Because one day?I might get hit by a bus. Maybe it’s weird. Maybe it’s scary. Maybe it seems downright impossible to just be—to just let people know you want them, need them, feel like, in this very moment, you will die if you do not see them, hold them, touch them in some way whether its your feet on their thighs on the couch or your tongue in their mouth or your heart in their hands. But there is nothing more beautiful than being desperate. And there is nothing more risky than pretending not to care. We are young and we are human and we are beautiful and we are not as in control as we think we are. We never know who needs us back. We never know the magic that can arise between ourselves and other humans. We never know when the bus is coming. ~ Rachel C. Lewis

146789	Love	146789.jpg	I have been thinking lots this weekend, and reflecting on so many things! But I’ve seen that the answer to everything is LOVE. Because with love we can do everything❤️ and love brings all the other things together, like happiness, fulfillment, success, friendships, family, unity, and so on. When we have LOVE we are whole and complete. I know in my heart that the injustices that we have in our world is because of the lack of love. People who love don’t hurt, that’s true to me and perhaps true to you as well🌟 but even when you LOVE don’t forget to NEVER take anything for granted, be grateful for what you have and who you have in your life, because it can be gone in the blink of an eye! So if you too want to choose love; then love deeply, fully, and truly❤️ love is infinite, love the people closest to you, love your neighbors, love strangers, love your enemies, love YOURSELF. Everyone needs love. So spread it, spread it like it were fire, like it were some good gossip, a new meme, spread it and enjoy it. In it you will find all the answers you seek🌟 My thoughts while sipping on my tea☕️ (at Miramar, Florida)

146938	Love	146938.jpg	・・? Your girl/wife is not just supposed to roll over and listen to everything you say because YOU’RE THE MAN. Not how it works KING And any man who publicly tries to suppress a woman’s power/creativity/intelligence/ talent to stroke his own, is truly weak behind closed doors A strong man is one who PROVIDES for his wife, continuously BUILDS her confidence so that she can be strong, LEADS his wife by example, and doesn’t force her to do anything because she does it out of trust that he has the right intentions for her life So, fellas, if you have to force your wife to follow you it’s because you’re not a strong enough leader and she doesn’t trust that you can excel in that category right now. Point blank. Go look in the mirror It’s definitely not because she’s “hard-headed?or doesn’t understand her role as a woman lol. You don’t excel at your role as a man/husband The goal should always be to have a woman that can provide/lead ya’ll family if you die today, so she needs to become POWERFUL WOMAN to do that To end my point, only a strong man can lead a powerful woman. They help each other. And I’m thankful for you ❤️

147505	Love	147505.jpg	4. What causes my heart pain? Trying to run in a dream often feels impossible. It also sucks when it feels that way in reality. “Good times for a change See, the luck I’ve had can make a good man turn bad So please, please, please Let me, let me, let me Let me get what I want this time? 5. What brings my heart joy? Holding off on making decisions that come from my ego instead of my heart. I’ll let my pride take a hell of a beating if it means my heart will have what it wants. I will swallow it whole with a side of crow to create a peaceful connection. Love is sacrifice. That sacrifice includes your ego. You don’t have to be right. You just have to be merciful. 6. How can I improve my self love? Resist temptation to indulge. Self discipline is a form of self love. It would be so easy to use cheap thrills to mask reality when it’s tough, but all that does is create more fucking drama and self loathing. 💘

147630	Love	147630.jpg	14 Days of Love 💕 ❄️🔥 - Kala Dandekar and Wolfgang Bogdanow (Sense 8) You can’t get more star-crossed and soulful than these two. He was a German mobster living in Berlin, and she was an upstanding, educated Indian, living in the upper caste of Bombay. However, though worlds apart, these two found themselves connected in the most unbelievable way. They were connected in mind, drawn to one another in body and eventually bound in their hearts. Their interactions were thoughtful, passionate, funny, occasionally tragic and at times odd, but they were always rootable, had mad chemistry and were fascinating to watch. They of course had their issues. How could they not with her living in India with a fiancée and eventual husband, and him living in Germany, dealing with the constant violence and death that was his life in the mob? How could they possibly have any semblance of a life together? Well their cognitive connection seemed to make their strange situation work. They were together, but not together. They could see each other, feel each other, experience what the other was experiencing without being physically in the moment with the other, which made their bond deeper and more intense. Though their relationship ended prematurely ?the show was cancelled after two seasons, I don’t think there is any doubt that these two lived happily, in their own unique and interesting way, ever after. 😊

147761	Love	147761.jpg	Testing. Trials. Hard times. They suck. It’s hard. You question everything, even your relationship w the Lord and still God is there. Waiting for you to trust Him. I’m going through a time of testing and what do I hear every time a doubt/fear comes to mind? “Do you trust Me??It’s hard. But I’m learning. All I want to do is hide from the world behind my iPad and watch Frasier?but that’s not what God has planned for me. So I keep going and trusting. Trusting that God is in control. Trusting that God knows what’s best for me. Trusting in God. (at Ballenger Creek, Maryland)

148302	Love	148302.jpg	The first time I was old enough to vote was the presidential election of 2016. I didn’t know who to vote for. Do I choose the lesser of two evils? Do I choose a lesser known candidate that won’t make it? Or should I write…Ellen or Oprah? The excitement of my first time being able to vote, quickly diminished as I did not truly believe in any of the politicians that were running. They did not stand for what I stood for. I wanted a president who wasn’t corrupt. Someone I could trust. Someone who believed in the same things I did? Someone who exemplified This time around, I have found that person. I know what I am fighting for and what I stand for. I will be voting for Please text ALOHA to 48728 to show your support.

149028	Love	149028.jpg	Причины, по которым аффирмации не работают. 🦋🦋🦋 Аффирмации ?один из самых сильных инструментов, которые можно использовать для повышения уверенности в себе и развития личности. Они просты, легки в освоении и эффективны. То, что мы себе говорим каждый день, становится для нас истиной. Множество людей пробовали использовать аффирмации и разочаровались в них. Из-за недостатка терпения или отсутствия видимых и измеряемых результатов. ⭐️Так же мы разочаровываемся в медитации или развитии хороших привычек, ведь это требует еще и времени. Но то, что аффирмации не работают в конкретном случае, не означает, что они неэффективны в целом. ⭐️Давайте выясним, какие ошибки совершает человек, когда пытается использовать аффирмации. ⭐️1. Отсутствие регулярности. Это первый и главный фактор, почему аффирмации могут не сработать. Сама их суть заключается в том, чтобы повторять их снова и снова, пока не надоест. А когда надоест, продолжать, пока не понравится. Вы повторяете аффирмации достаточно часто? Или время от времени? Кто-то сказал: «То, что вы делаете время от времени ?не так уж важно. Гораздо важнее то, что вы делаете постоянно». Если вы хотите, чтобы аффирмации работали, нужно применять их каждый день. Это должно стать привычкой. Через несколько недель вы сами будете на автомате повторять про себя фразы, которые повышают уверенность в себе и поднимают настроение. (at Planet Earth)

У меня и так сериал огромный, я едва поспеваю за действием. Я долго думаю, прежде чем набрать чей-нибудь номер и предложить увидеться. Выигрывают только очень любимые, предельно лёгкие в общении, только те, с кем не тягостны паузы, кто не ждёт от меня цирка и фейерверка, не задаёт лишних вопросов и всегда поймёт. Всё больше людей вокруг, а меня всё меньше. Кого я вспомню потом из этого времени, человек пять, и то, самых близких. Мне больше неинтересно экстенсивно расширяться впустую, мне хочется интенсивно, вглубь♥️ (at Planet Earth)

I love that Nathan is keeping his spirits up & still smiling as he keeps us updated on his experience as a The I’ve come to know and love over the years always has a positive outlook. Sending him lots of love and positive healing vibes. I can’t wait to cheer you on when you make your triumphant return to the pool. ❤️😁🐻 ・・? Thank you to everyone for all your unbelievable support! Quick update: I underwent a laparoscopic RPLND procedure yesterday which means they took out some of my lymph nodes that the cancer may have spread to with the help of a robot 🤖. My doctor said it went well and my pathology report (which will tell us if it had spread) should be back in another week or so. Until then, we are going to do everything we can to get back to normal life as quickly as possible while staying well within my doctors?parameters of course!

151237	Love	151237.jpg	🙄 ・・? Big Difference! 💯💯	
151275	Love	151275.jpg	You are the love of my life. As I am yours. You bring me sunshine, rain, and storms. Yet there’s no one else I’d rather have by my side. You have brought out the worst in me, but most of all the best in me. You have brought so much joy and love into my life. Your heart is so full of love that sometimes you don’t even realize you’re being taken advantage of and I just want to always protect it and you from the horrors of the World and other people. I never truly valued the meaning of “making love?until you and have never felt so safe as I do when I’m in your arms. Even though we bought a house together, my home is your heart - it’s wherever you are. And although life has made things difficult for us lately, I know we’ll stand true and tall and come out of this stronger than we ever were to begin with. You and I? We’re what people spend their entire lives praying for. You and I? We were born from the same star in the sky. You’re my forever. You’re my always. You’re my person. And there’s no better feeling than hearing you tell me the same thing. I wished and prayed every night and day at 11:11 for someone like you. And on 11/11/2015 my wish came true.

But I will not heal if it is very strict, mentally challenging and painful. But for ❤️? I would go through any amount of pain for love ❤️, even if it may be painful @ first I would do any sorts of fathomable and unfathomable feats, just to express how much I feel that emotion of love 💕.

153415	Love	153415.jpg	When life pushes against you, you have to push back! 💪 📣I know you get tired. I know you try & try & sometimes trying seems to get you nowhere. 💡But think about this: think about a time when you saw a person that you hadn’t seen in a long time & that person looked so different you almost didn’t recognize them. 💭Now, think about someone that you see daily, like your kids or even yourself. Then, think of how someone else mentioned the changes that have taken place in you or your kids. Ironically, you didn’t notice the changes because you see you & your kids all the time. On the other hand, other people can recognize changes easily when they aren’t constantly looking at you or your kids. 🔦You were able to recognize changes in the person you hadn’t seen a long while because you aren’t consistently looking at them. 👉Well, this concept applies to whatever you’ve been focusing on & feel hasn’t been changing. It only seems like it isn’t changing because you’re always focusing on it. 👀 So don’t give up just yet. 💡Besides, a house is built brick by brick & it might not look like much at first but if you keep building, it can turn out to be a massive creation! 🏰

153767	Love	153767.jpg	We live in a world that most believe we have to obtain things to be happy and wealthy. This couldn’t be further from the truth. Happiness and Wealth is all about giving. When you give Gratitude, Compassion and Empathy, you truly start to understand what a sustainable happiness is. No wealth can buy you this. But by doing this will make you beyond wealthy. For everyone lives is in a constant search for this sustainable happiness. Gathering this and buying that, thinking these things will make them happy. This instant-gratification does make them excited and may bring a short moment of joy but the newness wears off and then they begin their never-ending search again for that happiness that seems to keep eluding them.

154020	Love	154020.jpg	What is the right relationship !! A relationship where both can express their truest self without getting judgements, a relationship where both uplifts each other, a relationship where they are true and loyal to each other, a relationship, where noone hurts each other intentionally, a relationship where both are vulnerable to each other crossing the barrier of ego and false pride. A relationship where the love is more about being there for each other’s need than being selfish need A relationship like that is hard to come to by in a times like this, whoever have a true relationship should appreciate it and be grateful for it because not everyone have a relationship, many are dying to have a relationship like that. One of the things people do most in such situations is they compromise and gets into a relationship that just doesn’t have that spark or passion, these relationship won’t fulfill you, you will never be able to truly bond or make a connection at a deeper level where nothing else matters, not their look, race, culture, color, money or social status only thing that matters is the person. But many people are not going compromise these things ! But there are also so many people who is not going to listen to man made reasons, social norms, they would instead listen to their heart because hearts knows best what you really want.

It’s hard to believe a year has gone by already, yet it also feels like we’ve been married for ten years. This year had its ups and downs but not only did our marriage remain strong throughout it all, it became even stronger. Getting married lifted us to a new level in our relationship I didn’t even know existed. As we celebrate our first anniversary today, I’m thinking of our wedding day and all the joy and love that day brought. Happy first anniversary, my love!

154488	Love	154488.jpg	The Poppy Field Deborah Carr Young nurse, Gemma, is struggling with the traumas she has witnessed through her job in the NHS. Needing to escape from it all, Gemma agrees to help renovate a rundown farmhouse in Doullens, France, a town near the Somme. There, in a boarded-up cupboard, wrapped in old newspapers, is a tin that reveals the secret letters and heartache of Alice Le Breton, a young volunteer nurse who worked in a casualty clearing station near the front line during world war one.	
154562	Love	154562.jpg	Good things I did in 2018 (in no particular order-but only the good): 1. Published my Greek mythology mermaid fantasy Salt for Air 2. Finished writing the first 2 books in my Robin Hood series 3. Outlined all the way to the 5th book in said series 4. Published all six issues of our freelance magazine 5. Helped all my “kids?(students) pass their exams with flying colors 6. Wrote the new Regency Retelling of beauty and the beast way past the midway point 7. Kept myself alive (mostly) 8. Laughed a lot 9. Went on a trip with the dude (our first!) 10. Wrote 4 plays, performed and directed all of them 11. Did our first huge event with The Book Robin Hoods (it was a giveaway, find it under the hashtag winner will be announced in the next few days) 12. Kept up with writing my blog columns: Writer to Writer, The Mermaid Diaries and The Robin Hood WIP diaries 13. Had my dream come true when my favorite posted photos of Salt for Air 14. Slowly weaned out a false friend who used to put me down all the time and gained 3 valuable new ones who build me up and I hope to keep them for the rest of my life 15. Watched a good movie or two 16. Made the dude smile 17. Overcame bullying, sorrow, bouts of depression and much worse things (that I won’t mention because I don’t want to scare you) 18. Read a ton of books, some of which changed my life 19. I was given everything I asked for: His presence, His love, His guidance 20. I didn’t do all of these things by myself. He was here, holding my hand through it all, the good, the bad, and the really really ugly. It all comes from and belongs to Him.

155633	Love	155633.jpg	Many ask why I don’t post club music. Well, for me, I don’t like to be influenced by another’s sound. I produce what is needed for myself at that time. I will never submit to a single genre. I’m from New York. Born a breed during the golden days of NYC nightlife. it was about An overall sound, never about genre. If this hurts me or prolongs the process, so be it. Who said I was doing any of this for you? Lol. What I share in my productions is my interpretation from MY Journey with sound. Some will enjoy. Others will criticize. Music should set you free not confide you. (at New Jersey)

155872	Love	155872.jpg	Welcome to my tumblr blog! This will be a place where I share all things eco! Over 2017 I made a decision to move away from fast fashion and towards sustainable living. I have researched hard to find the most sustainable and ethically conscious way to live. I now want to share what I have learned, as I know just how daunting it can be to move away from consumeristic living. So if you are interested, keep checking my page or Instagram livec0. I decided to make lingerie my first post because I am truly passionate about having beautiful, yet comfy, underwear. What you wear underneath - for you - can truly help build confidence. I love this set from WORON. Woron is a fantastic sustainable brand, with strong sustainable practices. They emphasise comfort, without sacrificing shape, fashion & style without sacrificing sustainability. Seriously do check them out. The price point is ££, but definitely worth it!

156812	Love	156812.jpg	Be your own individual. I have always been inspired by people who are happy being themselves. I have always tried to be myself, despite being teased often for it. I am actively working on not letting other people’s opinions affect me. It is not an easy process, but I am progressing at it. I love to wear bold-colored lipstick like the one above (old picture). I feel like my lipstick is a great way to express myself. I no longer fear a bold lip, unlike before. I gained the courage to wear the lipsticks I usually only put on in the privacy of my room when I saw my beautiful friend wear a very red lip color one day. I used her courage to give me courage. That is the truth. So, just as my friend helped me embrace myself, I hope to help you do the same. So be you. Express yourself how you want to. Be the confident person you admire. I love you all! Be happy. Peace, Love and Macrame! ~ Pia Consuelo

I’ve always been in love with love 💕 in love with the best version of you 😘and about 18 years ago, outside my decade of suffering love, I had an awareness of something greater than the mixing of each other, sharing issues, problems and trauma. I was aware that something different in love was possible when we aren’t looking to get lost in someone else or find ourselves in them. Something delicious. Like addition to. Funny thing is, I thought to speak about it meant I had to master it and it turns out, I’ve been being it all along. Who’s ready to add something great to their life? (at Bellingham, Washington)

157681	Love	157681.jpg	Quanta gente já recebeu uma profecia em sua vida? O nascimento de Jesus foi o nascimento de uma promessa. Sua promessa não pode ficar no céu. O que o céu não pode conter passou a residir no útero de uma mulher. O fato de Jesus ter pisado na Terra trouxe todas as promessas que estão sobre a humanidade. Toda promessa precisa de um recipiente de fé para ser gerada. Assim como Maria foi um recipiente para gerar Jesus, assim será você gerando sua promessa. O que você está gerando será para abençoar uma multidão. As nossas conquistas atingem além de nossas necessidades, elas transbordam para que possa abençoar outras pessoas também. Maria foi a primeira pessoa a carregar Jesus, naquela gestação estava contido todo plano divino. Deus vai lhe dar uma gestação que vai trazer esperança a muita gente. A promessa que era esperada por centenas de anos, nasceu em uma manjedoura, em um local simples, eles esperavam um grande religioso, mas Deus lhes deu um príncipe da paz, eles esperavam um messias político, guerreiro, mas Deus deu um homem que promoveu a paz, que tinha paz dentro dele. Qual o nome da sua promessa? Deus a denominou de maravilhoso, Deus forte, Pai da eternidade, príncipe da paz. É preciso dar um propósito a sua promessa. Você pode começar agora! Se joga nos braços do Senhor, Ele deu a vida por você, você é dEle, viva por Ele! Que o sorriso do Senhor esteja sobre sua vida! - Ministério de evangelização Fala DEUS 📖🙌🏻🔥 - -

158251	Love	158251.jpg	Got myself a love fern ❤️ It’s true about 5 years ago I was standing in front of a man I loved, couldn’t choose while pretending I was choosing him and in this one moment, he wasn’t choosing me either. I quietly asked myself, what are you doing standing here and then I turned and walked away. Tears streaming, heart aching and total truth, I walked into a new adventure with me. For the last fiveish Years, I’ve played the distance game focused on everything except love. Distant adoration was great. Maybe I just wasn’t as love sick and mushy as I’d always believed I was. Then, I asked to have it all, let go of the either or game and really look at all in choosing while choosing me. About 18 years ago, I was aware of a possibility in relationships and creation that no one I shared with could perceive, I chose a wild adventure that showed me even more possibility with that and all the choices after have contributed. So I bought a love fern today, to nurture that romantic, goofy part of me, to call my attention to the simplicity of it all and to remind me of that interesting possibility that I am aware of in relationship. I’m opening the door to the next great love affair of this miraculous life. Who wants to join me? ❤️❤️❤️ (at Bellingham, Washington)

More than trying to be like someone else. We are already part of that “crowd? That special “crowd?that truly has a conscious. Within this crowd that we belong to, we must start to see how amazingly special we are as individuals. There really is no one like you. Never has been and never will be again. Make you mark on history. Be the most amazing and special you you can be. Want to know how? Secret Time: (not really a secret) 1. Sit down somewhere that is quiet. 2. Close your eyes. 3. Concentrate 4. Envision the very best you there is. The most compassionate. The most grateful. The most empathetic. That is the true you. That is the best you you can be. Without ego. Without judgement. Envision this everyday. Several times a day. This is who you should be. This is the person that will make a mark on history. This is the Miracle. You are the Miracle.

When you clear your clutter, you create space for new things and your energy and creativity will increase.?I found this Feng Shui quote intriguing as it implies ANYthing unresolved within the energetically of the homedweller (connections, feelings)Every being on the planet has a chance right now to start resetting their fresh new vision for the New Year🙌🏽~ each molecule that became upgraded through transformational activations in 2018, whether challenging or celebratory initiations, can gather this cellular 🧬 encoding into their new Vision? whilst also weaving in additional colorful and flavorful ingredients they desire🌟. This is a conscious choice notwithstanding procrastination or self sabotage! ☝🏽Re~memberjng that you are the Soul creator of your life enhances your ability to empower your perspective of what could become in 2019. This is the best time to resolve, bring completion or forgive The stale echo of what no longer resonates and to genuinely make amends with what you would like to switch out by recognizing something greater exists.. usually beyond your imagination🤔. My family is making a strong list of the lessons learned from 2018, including *going for it!, *uplifting ourselves rather than thinking limited, *scripting our new life on 📝 paper, and *blessing the souls we have let go of. So many extraordinary elements have revealed themselves during 2018, but it’s usually only through honest observation that we can create anything new or different within a higher Vision, along with determination and perseverance. For many spirits, this means to halt speculation and to start activating the goals! Divinely, the space we create, the stories we write and the mindfulness we develop, can be shifted into an alchemical ripe chapter including everything your soul desires, as long as you allow the Universe to assist you.

This little guy reminds me of those moments where even though you’re angry with your lover, it’s a different type of anger than you have with someone you’re not in love with. To give you a sense of the process of creating this I started out painting the (mostly now obscured) red leaping figure as a partner painting to the next artwork I’ll post. It was a joyful artwork and it stayed like that for weeks. Then I added everything else. I think of that process as parallel in many ways to the anger one might feel with their loved one. (📷:

159317	Love	159317.jpg	My nature is what Nature/God gave me. I don’t even have to correct it, change it to fit in to average which is a small box that people made up and believe, or exaggerate it to make them believe to force them to love me, since my nature is God-given: I am supposed to be who am, and being myself is my calling, that’s what I came here for. That’s why I follow my heart (what comes up naturally within me, not affected by Fear=Ego thoughts or world/opinion of others), I always be true to myself to be myself, knowing that’s the way to follow the flow of Nature, that’s the best way to accept everything God is trying to give me so that I can get the better future that He is trying to take me to. Which would I listen to Fear/Ego/Individual/Limited/Human of myself or [Fear = Ego] of someone to stop me and keep me in a small cage, or Nature/Universe/Infinity/Whole/Love/(Whatever you call it) God’s calling that I can hear through my heart to set me Free to become happier/better/greater to go through happier/better/greater future? That’s obvious: What [Love = God] is trying to say to me through my heart. - Lico

Most other mammals have a muscle mass that makes up 40 to 45 percent of the total body weight. Their specialised hands and feet have long, curved claws to allow them to hang upside down from branches without effort, and are used to drag themselves along the ground, since they cannot walk. On three-toed sloths, the arms are 50 percent longer than the legs.

I may have moved to Wales but they will never be rid of me 💜💜 I’m sat watching Love Actually with mumma and papa Lester and the pups. We ordered Indian and I have zero guilt. Yea I train over the holidays but I also relax my food and worry more about making happy memories with the people I love. Do what makes you happy! Don’t worry about others. Don’t worry what people say you should do and just do what feels right. Have a wonderful day tomorrow, may the drama be minimal the food be plentiful and the love be encompassing 💜💜 (at Basildon, Essex)

161456	Love	161456.jpg	I passed away and came back to life. I am healthy now and have a beautiful message for us to share to all the living. I was told to kindly contact you in support of world peace. Friendship and honor among each other and all GOD our Creators creations. If the universe was 1 degree off. Not even bacteria would exist. Stephen halkens and Einstein both agreed. Numbers don’t ad up. Everything was created by a unknown power that is our Creator we call GOD, ALLAH, JEHOVAH, ELIE Etc. When I left my body after verifiable death and entered into another dimension. Jesus asked me “why should i let you into my kingdom??When I passed that test. GOD our Creator asked me “WHAT GOOD HAVE YOU DONE FOR MY CREATIONS??Before I was sent back here into my broken and busted up body. Jesus. The Son of our Creator we call GOD or ALLAH or JEHOVAH or ELIE or LORD etc said unto to me. “I charge you to Tell everyone on my planet this parable before I return. Your religions are like food. 1000’s are now everywhere. Even 100,000 of thousands claiming to be righteous feeding everyone innocent or not promising life after death. Remember people. Religion is like food. Listen but understand this. No matter where you eat from or what kinds of food you eat. Everything you eat ends up in one place. As it will be when you Passover and are delivered unto me. In other words. You will all end up in one place, in front of me and I shall ask you this WHY SHALL I LET YOU INTO MY KINGDOM? And my FATHER will ask you this WHAT GOOD HAVE YOU DONE FOR MY CREATIONS I CREATED? Everyone, You will know my truth in this. I have nothing to gain. I refuse money and heel the sick into life. My body died. And I’m alive again to bring you this truth. In the afterlife we call heaven does exist. When I passed judgement. I was give the EVERLASTING LIGHT and my new name that was a heavenly RYTHEM sounding a million times better then the harp and violin 🎻. I will tell you more if you want to hear. We have much work to do for our Creators Creations. Your Elvis

161552	Love	161552.jpg	・・? O que é Empatia: Empatia significa a capacidade psicológica para sentir o que sentiria uma outra pessoa caso estivesse na mesma situação vivenciada por ela. Consiste em tentar compreender sentimentos e emoções, procurando experimentar de forma objetiva e racional o que sente outro indivíduo. A empatia leva as pessoas a ajudarem umas às outras. Está intimamente ligada ao altruísmo - amor e interesse pelo próximo - e à capacidade de ajudar. Quando um indivíduo consegue sentir a dor ou o sofrimento do outro ao se colocar no seu lugar, desperta a vontade de ajudar e de agir seguindo princípios morais. A capacidade de se colocar no lugar do outro, que se desenvolve através da empatia, ajuda a compreender melhor o comportamento em determinadas circunstâncias e a forma como o outro toma as decisões. Ser empático é ter afinidades e se identificar com outra pessoa. É saber ouvir os outros, compreender os seus problemas e emoções. Quando alguém diz “houve uma empatia imediata entre nós? isso significa que houve um grande envolvimento, uma identificação imediata. O contato com a outra pessoa gerou prazer, alegria e satisfação. Houve compatibilidade. Nesse contexto, a empatia pode ser considerada o oposto de antipatia. Com origem no termo em grego empatheia, que significava “paixão? a empatia pressupõe uma comunicação afetiva com outra pessoa e é um dos fundamentos da identificação e compreensão psicológica de outros indivíduos. A empatia é diferente da simpatia, porque a simpatia é maioritariamente uma resposta intelectual, enquanto a empatia é uma fusão emotiva. Enquanto a simpatia indica uma vontade de estar na presença de outra pessoa e de agradá-la, a empatia faz brotar uma vontade de compreender e conhecer outra pessoa. Na psicanálise, por exemplo, a empatia significa a capacidade de um terapeuta de se identificar com o seu paciente, havendo uma conexão afetiva e intuitiva. (em Condomínio Residencial Real Ville)

161648	Love	161648.jpg	The Billionaire’s Assistant to Be - Scarlett’s Needs (on Wattpad) He would have never hired her. One glance at that woman and you could just tell she was trouble. Scarlett Archer being his new assistant stirred up lots of things at the office and not in a good way. When his mother decided it was time for him to get married and preferably to her friend’s daughter Lucian Starr decided that maybe the sassy new assistant is just what he needed to get out of this match-making disaster. Little did he know that Scarlett Archer is dealing with her own problems which are a bit more pressing than a meddling mom.

161658	Love	161658.jpg	Breathing Again In life we go through some very hard and trying situations. Each of us experiencing these trials differently to each other. No one can ever say that their experience is worse than another person. We are all unique as is the interpretation of our experience and the effect it has on us. There are so many of us out there who go on day to day with our own struggles and the constant mind chatter that we carry within us. The constant pain that sits inside of us, yet we carry on. We keep moving. We keep smiling and trying to live our life as best we can without making too much fuss about the wars, we fight inside us. Sometimes it is good to just sit with these emotions and to come to terms with what we are feeling. At other times it is good to not let these feelings run away with us. By this we stop over thinking about them and we compartmentalise them into files to be stored away. (get on with life) But what we are doing is causing a deeper-rooted problem that will surface again and again within our lives if we do not address and come to terms with (as best we can) the traumatic situations we have come through or are facing. We are no longer living in a world where emotions are a taboo and seen as inappropriate to have them let alone express them. Heaven forbid we ask for help because they are consuming us and eating away at us from the inside out like some dreadful disease. The reality is, if not checked that is exactly what it will do to you. You see the very word Disease is nothing more that a Dis-Ease with oneself. It is no longer ok to say, “oh just get over it?Well, you may as well not throw your rubbish out. Just keep pilling up the bags of rubbish in your home. 2 bags, 3, 10, 25, 50 bags that begins to smell up your home, rotting away in dark black bin bags sweating and suffocating. So much decay, mould and stuff that you have acclimated but have no clue as to what is in the bags anymore. Or what order they are in. which one did you fill first and where is it. Is that the one that has the most smell and decay. This is what our unchecked emotions are like and these go way back. But we have all been trained to supress emotions and operate in such a way as not to cause drama or be dramatic. Essentially, we are taught not to express any feelings that will make the people around us uncomfortable or burdened by our grief. And so, we are a society of deeply troubled beings full of garbage walking around trying to have relationships with friends, family, partners and co-workers while the whole time spilling out our rubbish all over the place making a mess of things as we go. Hurting people unconsciously as we go. Without being aware that it is US who causes the unhealthy situations by not addressing ourselves first. I wish to create a healthy platform of sharing. Where we can be a community that does not judge one another but has empathy for each other and wish to be there for each other. God knows the world may be full of people but is has become a very isolated world where we share more with Face Book than we do with each other. If we are to become strong individuals, we must be willing to be there for each other and help each other to stand. I look forward to sharing more with all of you in the coming months.

162099	Love	162099.jpg	You’ve achieved a great deal recently, and it’s delivered you to an entirely new chapter of your life. This path is solid and here to stay, but you are undoubtedly still feeling that something is missing. As long as you feel that way, then something is missing, of course. With SIX planets, including your own Pluto, sitting at the bottom of your chart, there’s plenty going on at the core of your being, as usual. As long as you’re focused within, you’re sure to realize what it is you’ve been searching for. That’s because of course, it’s been hiding in your heart all along. The Black Moon Lilith comes and visits Pluto two more times before the new year comes and she moves on. Nothing pulls the Light out of the shadows like the Black Moon does. It doesn’t get more exciting than that. ♏️♏️♏️♏️♏️♏️♏️♏️♏️♏️♏️♏️♏️♏️ Scorpio- you’ve learned quite a lot about yourself this year scorpio, but there is still much digging to do. And you may find more things to heal, and holes to fill up. But not to worry. Life is all about this deep self discovery for you. Continue to move as you always do, but be more aware with how you’re feeling. Don’t run away from your intense feelings anymore. Or else it will only continue to build up until you can’t take it anymore. Confront it and deal with it. That’s the new way for you as we enter 2019.

162152	Love	162152.jpg	This made me cry. I did not grow up around boys like this. I’m from a podunk town in Mississippi where black girls were shamed for having a period, for dating, for growing breast. We were shamed for simply being .. born female. We endures what is now seen as sexual harassment, sexual assault, rape, molestation,and incest…and shamed for telling. We were UNPROTECTED then sent out into the world to learn things we were never taught? Whoever is raising this young man, well done. I hope as long as I am able to live I can teach my son’s this kind of COMPASSION for others, this PROTECTION of the female spirit and little black girls. I promise my future daughter in law’s and grand children they will protect them…their hearts, minds, and bodies.

Just because you don’t know how & when you’ll get what you need & want, doesn’t mean you won’t get it. It just might not appear exactly as you expected because IT’S GOING TO BE 1000% BETTER! 🕯Trust God. Hold on. He knows what He’s doing! 🙏💓

163547	Love	163547.jpg	“You may not believe in magic, But don’t you think it strange, The amount of matter in our universe, Has never slightly changed, That all which makes your body, Was once part of something more, And every breath you ever breathe, Has seen it all before, There are countless scores of beauty, In all the things that you despise, It could once have been a shooting star, That now makes up your thighs, And atoms of forgotten life, Who’ve long since ceased to roam, May now have the great honour, To call your crooked smile their home, You may not believe in magic, But I thought that you should know, The makings of your heart were born, Fourteen billion years ago, So next time you feel lonely, When this world makes you feel small, Just remember that it’s part of you, And you’re part of it all.?~Erin Hanson Thank you my love for sharing these words with us 💙🙏 (at Mexico)

164725	Love	164725.jpg	💖💖💖Семилетние циклы жизни человека 💖💖💖 От 0 до 7 лет 🌟 Сильная связь с матерью. Горизонтальное познание мира. Создание чувств. Запах матери, молоко матери, голос матери, тепло матери, поцелуи матери являются первыми ощущениями. Период, как правило, заканчивается вылуплением из защитного кокона материнской любви и открытием более или менее холодного остального мира. От 7 до 14 лет 🌟 Сильная связь с отцом. Вертикальное познание мира. Создание личности. Отец становится новым исключительным партнером, союзником в открытии мира вне семейного кокона. Отец расширяет защитный семейный кокон. Отец становится ориентиром. Мать была любима, отец должен быть обожаем. От 14 до 21 года 🌟 Бунт против общества. Познание материи. Создание интеллекта. Это кризис подросткового возраста. Появляется желание изменить мир и разрушить существующие структуры. Молодежь нападает на семейный кокон, затем на общество в целом. Подростка соблазняет все, что «восстает», ?громкая музыка, романтические отношения, стремление к независимости, бегство, связь с маргинальными группами молодежи, анархистские ценности, систематическое отрицание старых ценностей. Период завершается выходом из семейного кокона. От 21 до 28 лет 🌟 Вступление в общество. Стабилизация после бунта. Потерпев неудачу с разрушением мира, в него интегрируются, желая сперва быть лучше, чем предыдущее поколение. Поиски более интересной работы, чем у родителей. Поиски более интересного места жизни, чем у родителей. Попытка создать более счастливую пару, чем у родителей. Выбор партнера и создание очага. Создание собственного кокона. Период обычно заканчивается браком. С этого момента человек выполнил свою миссию и покончил с первым защитным коконом. 🌟 КОНЕЦ ПЕРВОГО КВАДРАТА 4×7 ЛЕТ. 🌟 После первого квадрата, завершающегося созданием собственного кокона, человек вступает во вторую серию семилетних циклов.

164788	Love	164788.jpg	Você pode afirmar veementemente que não gosta dos sabores doces ou fortes, pode revisar o trabalho mais cuidadoso das melhores viniculas do planeta, pode até consumir pra socializar num jantar chique com para conhecer os pais de uma garota qualquer. Mas ao fim da vida, pode provar de um gosto completamente diferente, um sabor que se encaixou perfeitamente no seu paladar. Aquele que com um só gole, o fez dilatar as pupilas pela primeira vez. Por outro lado, aqueles que afirmam gostar demais do vinho. Que bebem de todos os sabores, garrafas, vinículas e teores. Esse, acaba sem nem uma esperança para encontrar seu preferido. Pobre indivíduo, acaba apreciando ainda menos do que o primeiro, que tanto tem medo de provar. Ao final da noite, precisa da ajuda dos amigos para reencontrar o rumo de casa, pois de tanto provar de diferentes sabores acabou que não sentiu o verdadeiro doce ou amargo de nenhuma delas.

166262	Love	166262.jpg	This feels so deep to me. Ive been working this on and off for a few months now. Mostly just a dab here and there of extra paint. I got on it last night and made good progress. At times when I was working at certain angles I thought I would slip or fall into it. The mix between the UV and regular paint is quite the dance. And another bit of info?always trust yourself. Cause in a world of liars and thieves and sharks it’s important to be true. To yourself. You cannot control others or the will of the world. But in the end when you die you will fly free. It’s the weight of evil and lies that holds your spirit to the earth. That is a hell to me. That’s my truth and it’s completely universal.

166307	Love	166307.jpg	The Mystery of Emrys House - Cast of Characters (on Wattpad) Gabriella Dickens couldn’t help but feel excited as she found herself moving to Pendragon Boarding School, in Scotland. A school built on the exact spot that Camelot once was built, supposedly. it was an awfully big adventure, but one her sister and Nanna felt she needed. However, nothing is how it seems. Maybe it was because she was new, but she was sure that something was up. First a mysterious letter appears in her locker, telling her it is her job to protect Emrys’s secret; second a necklace with a letter telling her the quest is now her’s. What is going on? what is the secret? and protect if from whom? what quest are they talking about? Her sister was the one to live an exciting life, not her! But she is not alone. Join Gabriella and her new friends in a world of Legends, Romance, pranks and High School. BOOK 2.5 (Spying series) (Spin off book of 3rd SERIES IN THE 13 DIMENSIONS UNIVERSE)

166859	Love	166859.jpg	When we get stuck in life, it is hard to find that energy to start that life we desire. It is hard to see any options when your view is blocked by the very box we are stuck in. Reality is that box or the thought of being stuck is just that. A thought. Part of our perception. Why is it we can change when forced or dependent to our survival at times? Why can’t we change at our choose? I’m here to tell you we can. We always have the choice. Sometimes all we need is just a shift in energy. To get a mere shift can change our perception. Our thoughts. How do you shift? How would you shift? Don’t you think it is time to find out? Be that powerful energy that you truly are.

167247	Love	167247.jpg	“Courage is looking fear right in the eye and saying, ‘Get the hell out of my way, I’ve got things to do.’?- Unknown Life will break you down and hurt you. Unfortunately nobody can protect you from that. You have to love. You have to feel. And you have to fight. Be strong. Kick life right in the ass. Prove life wrong.

167648	Love	167648.jpg	So there was this time when I was younger and I met a nice girl on the net who had something around 8 or 9 years more than I did and we sort of bonded quickly, mostly because I get easily attached and because she made it easy to get liked, chatting, being around and playing together. She was beautiful and kind, but stuff didn’t end well. I’m not even going to make any form of appeal to find her cause she pretty much kicked me from her life, just hoping she’s doing well and fixed her own problems instead of trying to help me with mine. xoxo Tashha

168827	Love	168827.jpg	Purtroppo, noi, noi donne intendo, chi più e chi meno, ci comportiamo sempre da vittime, ci crediamo sempre sottomesse e non riusciamo a reagire. Noi siamo succubi di noi stesse, del nostro ego mancato, del rispetto per noi stesse che non c'è, non esiste. Non esiste perché noi ci lasciamo picchiare, ci lasciamo insultare, stiamo zitte quando ci minacciano, ci danno ordini. Stiamo zitte sempre e sorridiamo quando ci chiama amore, vediamo sempre una speranza in uomini che non sono altro che nullità e noi lo sappiamo, ma non reagiamo, ci lasciamo vivere da una nullità che ci fa solo del male, che non ci valorizza come donne, ma ci insulta come sesso debole e ci disprezza. Mentre fuori, magari, c'è qualcuno che sarebbe capace di amarci. Non esiste! Non deve esistere una cosa del genere, non deve essere possibile. Gli uomini vanno educati al rispetto, per se stessi e per noi, per noi che li mettiamo al mondo, per noi che li cresciamo, educhiamo e amiamo, cercando di fare del nostro meglio. Dovrebbero solo ringraziarci sempre, ogni giorno e non insultarci e usarci come bambole del sesso o sfogo personale. Noi valiamo molto di più! (presso Milan, Italy)

We don’t have the right to pollute and abuse God’s property! ii. This principle applies to more than our sexual conduct. If our bodies belong to Jesus, we also have no right to be idle with, or wasteful of, what belongs to Him. Our bodies should be put to use glorifying God (Therefore glorify God in your body). “Your body was a willing horse when it was in the service of the devil, let it not be a sluggish hack now that it draws the chariot of Christ.?(Spurgeon) - (at Ballenger Creek, Maryland)

169738	Love	169738.jpg	​​Осознани?через тело 💕💕💕🌟💕💕💕 Все, что с вами происходит, вы ощущаете не только головой, но и телом. Проблемы возникают, когда вы проводите слишком много времени у себя в голове. От этого разгоряченная энергия почек устремляется в мозг, нарушая все мыслительные процессы и вынуждая мысли бежать по кругу. Со временем это приводит к психическим расстройствам, головным болям, негнущейся шее, мигрени, безумию и всяческим искажениям в вашей картине реальности. Причем все эти неприятности происходят не только в голове, но и во всем теле. Чтобы укрепить свою ци и получать от той же самой реальности максимальную отдачу, вы должны научиться осознавать себя на уровне тела ?именно здесь вырабатывается и хранится ци, так что черпать ее можно только отсюда. Это прямо противоположно ощущению, когда вы как бы видите себя со стороны, что нередко случается с теми, кто подолгу торчит у себя в голове. Методика укрепления ци строится на умении легко перебрасывать свой ум в любую часть тела. Чтобы освоить этот прием, нужно научиться «нащупывать» те или иные зоны ?скажем, низ живота ?изнутри и ясно ощущать, что там творится. Дочитав этот параграф, закройте глаза и мысленно перенеситесь из пространства между ушей в нижнюю часть живота, чуть пониже пупка. Представьте, что в этом месте имеется дыхательное отверстие (типа носа) и что вы дышите через него. Почувствуйте, нет ли здесь напряжения, даже совсем крошечного. Его тут просто не может не быть, если только вы не Будда, в коем случае, надеюсь, вам нравится этот текст, ?вот только неясно, на что он вам сдался? Продолжайте дышать таким макаром, ощущая, как это напряжение потихоньку улетучивается. Через какое-то время, скажем через тридцать шесть вдохов и выдохов, вы почувствуете в этой части тела приятное тепло (это и есть ци!). А теперь проделайте то же самое с другими органами и конечностями: с правой ладонью, левым коленом, солнечным сплетением (в верхней части живота) и так далее, стараясь ощущать это тепло все быстрее и быстрее, пока наконец не станете чувствовать его с полпинка.🐾🤪 (at Planet Earth)

169795	Love	169795.jpg	C'è un gioco di sguardi senza paragoni tra me e te. E solo il tempo ti insegna quanto un cane sia sicuramente tutto ciò che di più sincero potrai avere nella vita. Io so con certezza che lei non mi tradirà mai, so che capisce quando sto male, so che non mi mentirà, so che il suo affetto è vero, è davvero, davvero sincero! Hope per me è l'unica costante, l'unica certezza nella mia vita e probabilmente lo sarà sempre. Devo a questo cane tutta la forza che mi ha trasmesso in questi 3 anni e mezzo passati insieme, dopo tre traslochi in tre luoghi completamente diversi, e la tua capacità di adattamento è stata la chiave fondamentale per non farci separare. Più e più volte il pensiero di, a malincuore, doverti dare via mi ha frantumato cuore e cervello perché sapevo che solo cosi ti avrei permesso di avere una vita migliore. Ad oggi pensare la mia vita senza di te mi risulta impossibile e non riesco a trattenere le lacrime se penso che potrebbe succederti qualsiasi cosa. La verità, in fondo, è che tu sei la mia ancora, sei fondamentale, sei tutto ciò che si più bello possiedo e sei una gioia immensamente meravigliosa. Si, certo non è che faccia i salti di gioia quando devo uscire al gelo alle 8 del mattino o alla sera tardi e tantomeno quando devo rinunciare ad un viaggio o anche solo ad andare via per qualche giorno perché non posso permettermi un dog sitter ma, alla fine, la verità è che siamo io e te, tu ed io. Punto. Se fino ad oggi questa realtà non riuscivo a vederla adesso tutto mi risulta più chiaro: tu sei fondamentale per la mia esistenza ed io non posso fare a meno di te. Scusa se non te l'ho mai detto?Ti amo con tutto il mio immenso cuore. (presso Milan, Italy)

These are what I want you to be; Every time you come or go. Let them become what you mean; Each time you say you love me? .. ? Model: Poem:

169975	Love	169975.jpg	I always remember the time before I became a mum. When some people | moms told me: Enjoy your life before you have kids because afterwards everything is over. And they were right. It is. Everything is different now. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ I remember the feeling every time I heard this sentence and intimidated me. A lot. It made me insecure and sometimes left me question parenthood. Even if people maybe never meant it that way, it always had a strange | negative undertone. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Sure our life changed (a lot). But until now there has never been a day | moment | second where I regretted to have a child. Never! And I am certain I never will. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Sure life changed. Life became more complex. More complicated.. anxious.. fearful.. tiring.. exhausting.. crazy.. messy?louder. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ But.. also so much more fun.. joyful, colorful.. love filled.. happy.. exciting.. worthy. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ People always told me when we have kids we have to settle down. Travel less. Be more grounded. But hell NO! Why? You can do it! All of it! Just in a different way according to your toddler. Sure you cant hang out partying until 3 in the morning.. no wait.. you actually can.. BUT you don’t want too. Because suddenly there is this little human who means the world to you and NOTHING! absolutely nothing feels more important than that. So YOU MAKE THAT CHOICE OUT OF LOVE 💖 Not because society says so. Its YOU who consciously choose to set new priorities in your life without regrets. Because it feels you already have it all. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

170847	Sad	170847.jpg	C’?stato un periodo in cui mi arrabbiavo un sacco; un periodo in cui pretendevo le cose giuste ,quelle fatte bene. Mi si accartocciava lo stomaco e diventavo tutt’uno coi singhiozzi. Poi,crescendo,ho imparato a lasciar perdere. Non perché,oggi,mi importi meno. Però,ho imparato che il tempo restituisce il conto a tutti. Che non si può far finta per sempre. Che prima o poi,la natura,l’indole,la vera essenza di quel che siamo,viene fuori. E a quel punto,poi,la maschera non si appiccica più. Ci si può riempire la bocca di mille parole; ma,quando quelle parole non sono le tue,poi,la vita le riconduce al mittente. Non porto rancore e non nutro vendette: non sarei la persona che sono,altrimenti. Lascio che la vita faccia il suo. Che il tempo metta tutto in ordine. E nel mentre vado avanti,senza stancarmi di cercare il meglio. Quello autentico. Non costruito. Quello per cui ho continuato a fare del bene,anche quando ricevevo mancanze. Ho messo sempre il cuore dalla parte giusta,e questo,prima o poi,la vita se lo ricorderà. Tutto arriva per chi sa aspettare. Andrà meglio. (presso Torri Bianche Vimercate)

Me enseñaste que la vida está en caída tras caída Y que la felicidad se encuentra en mi interior. Gracias, Por creer en cada una de estas piezas rotas De este ser lleno de desastres. Gracias, Por confiar que lo podría, Por hacerme creer que era lo suficiente buena. Pero cariño, Te necesito Necesito mi brújula Mi camino.

Traigo regalitos (galletas) para compartir pero al final recibo un “gastas plata en hueas? Las familias no deberían ser así, hago algo mal, no soy la hija ejemplar, pienso. Me duele, admito que soy llorona, todo me afecta me siento débil, que no estoy preparada para esto. Mi mayor temor es quedarme sola, sin compañía ni nada, ya perdí muchos amigos y lloré lo suficiente, siento la necesidad de una “mejor amiga? conversar cosas de niñas, no es lo mismo contárselo a mi mamá, que plancha. A pesar de todo, a pesar que sigo siendo una ridícula “emo?triste tengo mi pedacito de luz que me hace dejar de lado mis pensamientos tristes y ya no pensar en acabar con mi mísera vida (pensé en hacerlo hace muchos años). No sé y no entiendo como hacer para deshacerme de lo mal que me siento, me duele el corazón, lo siento triste y amargado, siento el auto-odio, el no ser perfecta para mi misma. Cuando estoy feliz con mi pedacito de luz, les juro que me siento regia, bonita, la más mina pero algo me dice “te ves ridícula sintiéndote así? y vuelvo a lo mismo, a sentirme mal, a notar más lo ignorada que me siento por mis papás. A veces falta un abrazo, besos y apapachos, si ven a alguien triste no lo duden, esa persona necesita de alguien, que alguien sea su pedacito de luz. Amor, tenía ganas de escribir como siento, de lo agradecida que estoy de que estés a mi lado. De qué seas mi pedacito de luz y que estés a mi lado. Te amo infinito ❤️ (en Santiago, Chile)

175137	Sad	175137.jpg	Earlier this week, I sent out an email about my new book coming out in 2019, Every Word You Cannot Say, which is a collection of poetry about my own struggle with depression and what I feel like I can’t say, and what I wish someone would say to me. I asked everyone subscribed to my email feed (the link is in my bio, www.tinyletter.com/pleasefindthis) if they had things that they didn’t feel like they could say, that they wanted to say or share. They did. Here, anonymously, is what the people who sit next to you on the bus, across from you at the coffee shop, who serve you in restaurants, who drive past you on the street, cannot say. As I’ve said in this latest email, which has all the replies in it, the world is so rough right now. We all need to hold onto each other. Wherever you are, whoever you’re with, be kind and gentle with them and with yourself. There is so much we need to say to each other, that we don’t.

176136	Sad	176136.jpg	In December 2006, a guy named Lorenzo Montoya, who lived in a mobile home in the desert less than three miles from the mass burial site, was shot and killed in an incident that was ruled self defense. It seemed that Montoya had picked up a sex worker on the Albuquerque strip and the sex worker’s boyfriend/pimp followed him in order to provide protection. He waited for the girl to come out of the mobile home and when he became alarmed by how long it was taking, he knocked on the door. Montoya came out with a gun and began firing at the boyfriend but missed. The boyfriend retreated to cover, pulled out his own gun and shot and killed Montoya. He then went into the mobile home and found his girlfriend dead by stranglation. No charges were filed against the boyfriend. At the time this happened, law enforcement was not aware that local sex workers were disappearing. It was considered a “one off?crime that got minimal Medea attention. Two years laters, in 2009, 11 decomposed corpses were found buried in shallow graves. When the bodies turned up, investigators remembered the Montoya case. A look a Google Earth showed vehicle tracks leading directly from Montoya’s mobile home to the dump site. By that time, Montoya’s mobile home and all of his processions had been disposed of. Very little was known about Montoya but no ties could be found linking home to any of the women found buried at the site. Albuquerque investigators did not feel there was sufficient evidence to declare Montoya the perpetrator and close the case but he appears to be a much stronger suspect than any of the others developed.

177790	Sad	177790.jpg	At night the states I forget them or I wish I was there in that one under the Stars. It smells like June in this night so sweet like air. I may have decided that the States are not that tired Or I have thought so. I have thought that. At night the states And the world not that tired of everyone Maybe. Honey, I think that to say is in light. Or whoever. We will never replace you. We will never re- place You. But in like a dream the floor is no longer discursive To me it doesn’t please me by being the vistas out my window, do you know what Of course (not) I mean? I have no dreams of wake- fulness. In wakefulness. And so to begin. (my love.) At night the states talk. My initial continuing contr- diction my love for you & that for me deep down in the Purple Plant the oldest dust of it is sweetest but states no longer how I would feel. Shirt that shirt has been in your arms And I have that shirt is how I feel At night the states will you continue in this as- sociation of matters, my Dearest? down the street from where the public plaque reminds that of private loving the consequential chain trail is matters At night the states that it doesn’t matter that I don’t say them, remember them at the end of this claustro- phobic the dance, I wish I could see I wish I could dance her. At this night the states say them out there. That I am, am them indefinitely so and so wishful passive historic fated and matter- simple, matter-simple, an eyeful. I wish but I don’t and little melody. Sorry that these little things don’t happen any more. The states have drained their magicks for I have not seen them. Best not to tell. But you you would always remain, I trust, as I will always be alone. At night the states whistle. Anyone can live. I can. I am not doing any- thing doing this. I discover I love as I figure. Wed- nesday I wanted to say something in particular. I have been where. I have seen it. The God can. The people do some more. At night the states I let go of, have let, don’t let Some, and some, in Florida, doing. What takes you so long? I am still with you in that part of the park, and vice will continue, but I’ll have a cleaning Maine. Who loses these names loses. I can’t bring it up yet, keeping my opinions to herself. Everybody in any room is a smuggler. I walked fiery and talked in the stars of the automatic weapons and partly for you Which you. You know. At night the states have told it already. Have told it. I know it. But more that they don’t know, I know it too. At night the states whom I do stand before in judgment, I think that they will find me fair, not that they care in fact nor do I, right now though indeed I am they and we say that not that I’ve erred nor lost my way though perhaps they did (did they) and now he is dead but you you are not. Yet I am this one, lost again? lost & found by one- self Who are you to dare sing to me? At night the states accompany me while I sit here or drums there are always drums what for so I won’t lose my way the name of a personality, say, not California I am not sad for you though I could be I remember climbing up a hill under tall trees getting home. I was going to say that the air was fair (I was always saying something like that) but that’s not it now, and that that’s not it isn’t it either At night the states dare sing to me they who seem tawdry any more I’ve not thought I loved them, only you it’s you whom I love the states are not good to me as I am to them though perhaps I am not when I think of your being so beautiful but is that your beauty or could it be theirs I’m having such a hard time remembering any of their names your being beautiful belongs to nothing I don’t believe they should praise you but I seem to believe they should somehow let you go At night the states and when you go down to Washington witness how perfectly anything in particular sheets of thoughts what a waste of sheets at night. I remember something about an up-to-date theory of time. I have my own white rose for I have done something well but I’m not clear what it is. Weathered, perhaps but that’s never done. What’s done is perfection. At night the states ride the train to Baltimore we will try to acknowledge what was but that’s not the real mirror is it? nor is it empty, or only my eyes are Ride the car home from Washington no they are not. Ride the subway home from Pennsylvania Station. The states are blind eyes stony smooth shut in moon- light. My French is the shape of this book that means I. At night the states the 14 pieces. I couldn’t just walk on by. Why aren’t they beautiful enough in a way that does not beg to wring something from a dry (wet) something Call my name At night the states making life, not explaining anything but all the popular songs say call my name oh call my name, and if I call it out myself to you, call mine out instead as our poets do will you still walk on by? I have loved you for so long. You died and on the wind they sang your name to me but you said nothing. Yet you said once before and there it is, there, but it is so still. Oh being alone I call out my name and once you did and do still in a way you do call out your name to these states whose way is to walk on by that’s why I write too much At night the states whoever you love that’s who you love the difference between chaos and star I believe and in that difference they believed in some funny way but that wasn’t what I I believed that out of this fatigue would be born a light, what is fatigue there is a man whose face changes continually but I will never, something I will never with regard to it or never regard I will regard yours tomorrow I will wear purple will I and call my name At night the states you who are alive, you who are dead when I love you alone all night and that is what I do until I could never write from your being enough I don’t want that trick of making it be coaxed from the words not tonight I want it coaxed from myself but being not that. But I’d feel more comfortable about it being words if it were if that’s what it were for these are the States where what words are true are words Not myself. Montana, Illinois. Escondido. ?

Afinal nem sei se você existe? ou se nos conhecemos, e talvez tu apenas me observe andando por ai distraído em alguma esquina de Porto Alegre. Não quero te fazer perder tempo lendo nada, mas quero que saiba que sinto sua falta; e a verdade é que sempre acreditei que aqueles sonhos pudessem ser reais, que por algum momento você pudesse ser real? a garota de olhos claros e cabelo escuro que trouxe tantas alegrias no que posso dizer ser o meu maior sonho; hoje é apenas uma lembrança de algo que nunca aconteceu. Sim, por muitas vezes vesti fantasias em pessoas que pensava ser você, eu admito? mas ninguém pode me julgar por isso, ou será que pode ? Afinal eu quero te encontrar, mesmo que meu emocional não seja mais o mesmo, e que minha esperança esteja mínima, acho que não consigo desistir de tentar te encontrar? e onde quer que você esteja agora, quero que saiba que eu estou aqui, te esperando para ser o sonho das coincidências que nunca tivemos a sorte de ter

I found Toby dead around 10:00 on Tuesday, April 24th, 2018. He was a male betta that will be truly missed by those who saw him. (People said he was adorable since he would swim to the top of you called his name or shook the food container) He was always there to make me laugh when I was sad by doing little funny things. Whether they were intentional or just a betta thing still remains a mystery to me. He is now swimming with the fish from my early childhood. Rest In Peace, Toby. Rest In Peace. ~~💙~~

It’s not easy I live in a very difficult home and deal with a lot of stress, Yet I try and always make it look pretty. Someone commented on a post of mine today that I should keep traveling while they keep working. I was extremely hurt by this as it was a close friend. Don’t judge someone based on their Insta pictures. A little back story incase anyone was wondering how came back. I was back home in where I was about to get engaged to the man that i loved. The day it was supposed to happen everything went up in flames. Considering this happened twice in the past year you can imagine what state of mind I was in. Add to that the regular intense daily stress I have I felt like my world was crashing in on me and I had to get up and leave. I charged everything on my credit card and left. I sadly don’t have a big Insta following I can ask to donate to my go fund me page or anyone who will help me. But I have to believe that I will figure it out. So next time you see me smiling at don’t assume anything. Because you never know there might be a smile on my face but a lot of tears beneath my glasses.

179454	Sad	179454.jpg	O grande problema de tentar deixar ser aquilo que odeio eh exatamente a necessidade de me machucar. Todos estamos abertos a receber alguém em nossas vidas, e não eh que isso seja ruim, apenas sou falho quando me entrego de corpo e alma quando acho alguém beeem mais interessante. Veja bem, não eh novidade que eu luto contra minha ansiedade diariamente e tudo que já fiz pra tentar me fechar. Infelizmente um ponto sempre acaba se abrindo novamente. Eh aquele tipo de cicatriz que nunca fecha, e eu sei disso. Um unico momento. Eh tudo que preciso pra abrir todas as feridas e me lembrar do quão idiota eu sempre sou. Eu falei de momentos da ultima vez e de como eles eram importantes, e claro, esses também fazem parte: os ruins, os dolorosos. A grande questão eh que todos são relacionados a mim. Eh claro que o problema sou eu e minha inabilidade de lidar com o que sinto, e isso me afeta de uma maneira que atrapalha tudo que faco em todas as ocasiões. Ontem pensei bastante sobre umas coisas e fiquei triste sobre o resultado, minha ansiedade foi a mil, minha cabeça não parou um minuto. Sabe aquela famosa frase “perdi o controle sobre minha vida? haha, ta, nao eh tao famosa assim mas eh exatamente o que aconteceu. Agora, imagina uma linha, e presa a esta linha imagine várias bexigas penduradas em outras linhas presas a esta linha. Imagina tudo se batendo e voando e rodando, mas seguindo presas a linha: esta eh minha vida emocional. Nao eh que eu seja descontrolado, eu não sou, sou o contrário disso, eu controlo cada sentimento que externo e esse eh todo o problema, pq o problema ta na minha cabeça e o tanto que eu controlo tudo dentro de mim. Eu já tentei deixar tudo sair, deixar tudo aflorar como se eu pudesse confiar nisso, que alguém iria segurar a barra dessa experimentacao. Obvio que nao deu certo. O que aconteceu foi que eu me gerei mais problemas e estou ai até hoje. Se você me perguntar o que eu quero de verdade, eu consigo te responder de uma maneira fácil : reciprocidade e a não desistencia. Não peço nada mais do que aquilo que forneço. Porque sou assim, infelizmente, me entrego por inteiro quando quero, vou embora pra nunca mais voltar se assim decidir. Eu já perdi muito por nao ter descoberto tudo isso antes, mas, na epoca nao tinha muito o que fazer. Os dias eram mais simples, mas já ficou tudo pra trás. Minha busca não terminou e sei que um dia vai dar certo, afinal, todos merecemos ser felizes, nao? nao.. ?

179927	Sad	179927.jpg	Bald hast du es wirklich geschafft, dass wir uns verlieren.. das du mir so in den Rücken gefallen bist und eine Feindin von mir umarmt hast, vor meinen Augen. Allein das Bild jede Minute vor meinen Augen tötet mich.. der Gedanke daran, dass du mir so was angetan hast macht mich so aggressiv und tötet mich zugleich. Du siehst diesen Fehler ja nicht mal ein.. Nein. Stattdessen sagst du noch „es war doch nur eine Umarmung.? Verdammt! Ja, es war nur eine Umarmung, aber für mich eine bittere Umarmung. Eine Umarmung die unsere Beziehung kaputt macht.. du hättest zweimal nachdenken müssen, aber anscheinend hast du gar nicht nachgedacht. Das es eine Klassenkameradin von dir ist, ist gerade so an der Grenze, denn du hast täglich Kontakt zu ihr, du siehst sie öfters als mich, aber gut, dass muss halt sein. In der Klasse fallen auch mal Umarmungen, ist nichts unnormales. Und das man auch nicht wegzieht oder „ne danke?sagt, weil man nicht vor anderen Klassenkameraden blöd da stehen will, ist auch gerade so ok. Aber in der Öffentlichkeit, wo man mit seiner Freundin unterwegs ist, kann man nicht zurück ziehen oder wie? Schule und Privat ist ein großer Unterschied. Du weißt schon lange, dass sie eine Feindin von mir ist und trotzdem fällst du mir so in den Rücken..?? „Dein Feind, ist auch mein Feind? dass ist Loyalität, aber niemand schätzt es mehr.. mir wurde es von klein auf unter die Haut genagelt, deswegen trifft es mich so hart. Von der Person, von der man es am wenigsten erwartet, enttäuscht einen so sehr..

Nos vamos con nuevas historias, nuevos recuerdos, viejos amigos y nuevos que conocimos en el camino. Nos vamos con melancolía de ver un país con mucho potencial pero que se olvidó de su gente, de la educación que lo caracterizaba y la educación cívica de la que siempre me sentí tan orgullosa. Chau amigos lindos y charlas profundas. Chau mates y atardeceres inigualables. Los voy a extrañar Y MUCHO! Pero a pesar de todo lo que me faltará allá, elijo vivir en un país sin inseguridad, sin envidia, sin diferencias sociales burdas y donde me siento respetada por el prójimo. Donde la diversidad es la norma y no existen los amiguismos. Donde el YO está al servicio de NOSOTROS. Un beso enorme y GRACIAS POR TODO! Los espero en Vancouver si se animan a venir! 😘 😘 😘 (at Aeropuerto de Carrasco)

182211	Sad	182211.jpg	It is with a very heavy heart that I share that Lenny passed away last night at the Purdue Large Animal Hospital from complications relating to aspiration pneumonia. The staff at the hospital did everything they could to save him, but his stubbornness in showing his symptoms means that the situation was out of control before it was obvious something was wrong. He was 7 years old. He will always be remembered as the loving, stubborn deer that he was. He will be missed and my world is a little bit dimmer without him in it.

But that in itself is okay. No one can really tell you anything you didn’t already know or haven’t told yourself. You’re broken. You’re lost. You need help. You’re lonely. And you think, yes, obviously. And you think, but I know how to handle this. And you think, but change is scary. And you think, maybe it’s easier to stay this way.

184603	Sad	184603.jpg	i will never be able to love you how i want to i want to love you without hesitation, trusting, and happy instead you’re emotional and unpredictable stressed. angry. you always have been, always will. I’m scared to open up in case you use it against me later. you don’t notice something’s wrong unless i mention it, but only to you first. if my psychiatrist hears it first i might be skewing it out of proportion, or might be interpreting things through a mentally ill lens. God forbid my mental illness affects any other part of my life, then i need to pull myself together, because that’s what adults do. I’ll say i’m okay, because that’s what adults do. and you want me to be grown up right? you want me to get my shit together and be who you wished you could be. but im not. im a disappointment that is going to end up poor and crazy

184801	Sad	184801.jpg	I’m so over 2018 already! In the past two days, we have had our pipes freeze, the electrical go out in the outer building combined with the wind blowing open the shed doors which not knowing until the morning caused us to lose 4 leopard geckos, 3 breaded dragons, 2 tegus including my beloved gronkette:( and 16 ball pythons, to top things off I wake up to an old water like me this morning that ruptured and is flooding the backyard while it’s snowing so have had to cut the water main off till I can tend to it after driving to Carteret to work. Only good thing out of all this is it snowed. I’m ready for the year to be over :(

184950	Sad	184950.jpg	December 31, 2017: This is me being petty as fuck but here it goes?One thing I learned this year is that sometimes you work so hard on something for so long. Let’s say four years.. And you work for free with the will to learn more, while remaining enthusiastic about what you are asked to do and they tell you you are great at what you are doing, and you hope every month that the people you work for will thank you for it or recognize you for it in some way but that never happens so you learn to deal with it BUT THEN a new student marches in, tries the job, doesn’t do it very well and then hate the job so they want them to stay and they end up getting offered to get paid. So all your dreams are crushed and you lose the will to work towards anything in life anymore and theres nothing anyone can do about it and the new kid rubs it in and also steals all your friends and self respect

185059	Sad	185059.jpg	If we never experience the chill of a dark winter, it is very unlikely that we will ever cherish the warmth of a bright summer’s day. Nothing stimulates our appetite for the simple joys of life more than the starvation caused by sadness or desperation. In order to complete our amazing life journey successfully, it is vital that we turn each and every dark tear into a pearl of wisdom, and find the blessing in every curse. -Anthon

185598	Sad	185598.jpg	Today I decided to pick up the pencil, scribble a little and then the brush to scatter some paint on a plain paper meant for writing; slowly, awakening my creative soul after a long period of mental breakdown dealing with heavy confusions, having been neglected and badly sympathizing myself for not having proper counselling over my mental illness and my friends not understanding what’s happening to me either and why I felt this way, to sum it all up, I have been numb and literally stopped trying for myself, I stopped living, did absolutely nothing but the same routine that’s essential to keep me breathing. But today is different, I decided to fight a little more even though my feet couldn’t keep me from standing yet- sitting isn’t such a bad thing as long as I’m not slouching. Today I made art and wore it as an armor. (unfinished)

187002	Sad	187002.jpg	Betters as Strangers. I hate that we would make better strangers than me being a part of your life. If I’m going to be honest with you, I never understood why it was so difficult for exes to be friends and why rejections had to mean goodbye…until now that is. Are you ready for the cliche: It’s not you, it’s me. Let me explain; I wish I could say I hated you and mean it; that I despised something about you and that I don’t care about you anymore…but I can’t because I would be lying not only to you, but myself. I can’t suddenly say all those things just because you no longer like me the same way I like you. Maybe that’s the problem, that every time I’m around you, I know that I can’t just turn off these feelings for you. I can try to be strong and try the ‘just friends?thing, but it would hurt us both if I stayed because hope would creep up and place us again in this uncomfortable situation yet again. Worst of all, it would tough being around you and knowing I wasn’t enough for you. As much as I want to see you happy and in love, I can’t be around to find out the person who will do that for you knowing it won’t be me. You’ll always be someone I care about but in the end, I think we both know we’re better as strangers.

Una volta intraprendente, l’altra impacciata. Una volta esuberante, l’altra timida. Insicura e decisa. Dolce e arrogante. Era mille donne lei, ma il profumo era sempre lo stesso.. Inconfondible. Era quella la mia unica certezza. Mi sorrideva, sapeva di fregarmi con quel sorriso. Quando sorrideva io non capivo più nulla. Non sapevo più parlare né pensare. Niente, zero. C’era all’improvviso solo lei. Era matta, tutta matta. A volte piangeva. Dicono che in quel caso le donne vogliono solo un abbraccio. Lei no. Lei si innervosiva. Non so dove si trova adesso ma scommetto che è ancora alla ricerca di sogni. Era matta, tutta matta.. Ma l’ho amata da impazzire.? _Cit. Charles Bukowski 💬 PH: 😍 (presso Terme del Corallo)	
187446	Sad	187446.jpg	There is a light that never goes out	
187473	Sad	187473.jpg	On the night of the 24th of February, 1978, a group of five young men - who were all a part of a program for the mentally handicapped - attended a college basketball game at California State University, Chico. They were: Jack Madruga, 30, William Sterling, 29, Ted Weiher, 32, Gary Mathias, 25, and Jack Huett, 24. The group of men had been anticipating their Special Olympic basketball tournament; if they won, they got a trip to Disneyland in California. But they never made it to their game. Following the college basketball game, the men drove to a convenience store in downtown Chico to purchase snacks and drinks. This was at approximately 10PM. After departing the store, the men were never seen again. Several days later, their abandoned car was found some 70 miles away on a Plumas National Forest road. An investigation of the car revealed it was in working order. The elevation of the site is 4,400 feet and the area was surrounded in snow. It wasn’t looking optimistic; the missing men were wearing only light clothing. After the discovery, a severe blizzard blanketed the area, hindering search efforts and covering potential tracks. Four months later, a group of motorcyclists went to a trailer maintained by the Forest Service around 19 miles from where the car was found. They noticed the window was smashed and inside, they found the decomposed body of Weiher. They also found food, clothing, books, matches and fuel, all of which had been untouched. There was enough food to feed the five men for over a year. Weiher had remained alive for up to two months before dying or starvation and hypothermia. The late spring thaw then uncovered the bodies of Madruga and Sterling around 11 miles from the car. Both died of hypothermia; investigators theorised that one may have succumbed to the desire to sleep that marks the final stage of hypothermia and the other refused to leave his side. Shortly afterwards, Huett‘s father - who had joined in on the search - found his remains 2 miles from the trailer. This led investigators to believe that he had been in the trailer too before venturing out where he died. Despite an exhaustive search, Mathias was never found. Evidence inside the trailer indicated that he too had been hiding out in the trailer. They found Mathias?trainers inside. The discovery of the bodies led to even more questions. Why would they walk more than a dozen miles uphill through snow instead of walking downhill or remaining in their car? And even more tragically, why would at least one of them - Weiher - live for more than two months in a forest service trailer yet ignore the food, clothing and fuel around him before death? Their families stick to their belief that somebody forced the men up that mountain road and ultimately, to their deaths.

187525	Sad	187525.jpg	To be frank, my mental health, sanity and mood have been questionable at best lately. It’s been a hard few days/weeks/year/fuckyou2017. Spent many years doing a lot of hard work to come as far as I have. So these rough days sting a bit more than it feels like they used to. Sometimes we forget how much those around us are capable of hurting since we get lost in the series of 10 second stories. So here’s a very real sad post in the midst of the cool things in my life to remind myself that this is real and okay too. Anyway, this was for me and an attempt to embrace vulnerability and recognizing the balance that life requires. But if you’re having a bad day, maybe it’ll remind you that you’re okay and normal and you’ll be fine and I’ll be fine because this is how life works. Also I’ve loved most of my internet life so here’s a particularly relevant illustration.

I had hopes for next season but I just can’t see it being as successful based on where I am in my riding career. I will forever be grateful for this opportunity and hope one day experience the exact same feeling as I did then.

189189	Sad	189189.jpg	Aquella mujer Me perdí en los ojos de aquella mujer tan claros como el atardecer, su piel morena me incitaba a morder sus labios y sentir su amor extraordinario, esa calides de a diario que necesita mi alma para no estar tan vacía y sola en este mundo extraño pero nada resulto como lo tenia pensado, estoy desesperado entre la depresión, el odio y el pasado, señales me han dado pero no logro captarlo creo que no puedo estar esperando el mismo amor que he brindado el tiempo de mis manos se ha escapado, los celos me poseen y en desesperación me pierden por no querer abandonar lo que parece irreal, mi corazón por ti late mas de mil veces en un segundo, se siente como una bomba en mi pecho escuchando el click clack, apunto de estallar, tantas decepciones amorosas que ya no sabes si confiar, la gente no suele comprender lo que es el ser traicionado por la persona que mas has amado, olvido rápido pero en mi subconsciente aun esta oculto almacenado, le pongo un candando a mis emociones, acostado en mi cama con una base de desahogo libero lo que oculto el dolor moribundo que trago día con día, las 24 horas del día vivo con plena mascarilla felicidad, estupidez y alegría, 12 de la noche y es hora de salir al techo a redactar poesía de calle, no ocupo disfraces cuando escribo soy crudo como la realidad que vivo, hicieron mi vida un mito la gente habladora, mucho tiempo fui de boca en boca como el humo del cigarro, ando pa todos lados y sin tener carro, camino en esta pequeña ciudad solo, muy solitario, no necesito que la gente me haga sentir amado tampoco he necesitado estar acompañado crecí solo desde el kinder y eso lo tengo claro las personas se van en el tiempo menos esperado como aquella mujer con la que sueño noche tras noche esa pintora que ira por un titulo dejos de aquí y tal vez sea una gran doctora o lo que decida ser estoy harto de ver las manecillas del reloj correr, solo la fría lluvia del anochecer me ayuda a ocultar mis lagrimas de una noche mas de locura de amor odio que hayan quitado mi candado de lado amoroso y sin esfuerzo alguna, esto es terrible al romper el candado tiendo a ser mas sensible y demostrar la debilidad ante toda esta gente que logra entender cosas inexplicables como el amor de mi corazón crecer con cada sonrisa que me causar al poderte ver en cada sueño, escribo verso tras verso de amor, cariño, odio y desprecio, la gente ah olvidado como es expresarse en versos y perderse en largos textos de emociones, estoy dando lo ultimo de mi en mi vida y emociones, perdí el interes en aquella mujer de ojos cafes de mil pasiones, pensaran que soy malo y de lo peor y no están equivocados pero no puedo esperar otra cosa de ver las señales que me han dado una vez mas tendre que coser mi corazón a mano y mi alma dejarla fría y vacía en un rincón oscuro y olvidado, pero debo aceptarlo por esa mujer moriría sin pensarlo

189498	Sad	189498.jpg	Game Development Harpeetle The very first Rayman game inspired this creature design, I absolutely love the band/music themed world. I’ve kind of used the shape here to inspire this harp/beetle design, following it loosely. I haven’t got many creatures developed for my music themed world, and I felt that this was the perfect opportunity to design an enemy for this section. I followed a reference to get the colours and legs just right, I think his abdomen is coloured and toned in just the right way.

Выписали новые антидепрессанты, которые правда помогали 3 недели, но теперь от них не осталось эффекта, хоть я и продолжаю их пить. Долго я буду зависеть так сильно от биохимии в своём организме? Наступает ещё период того, что я хочу просто прекратить есть. Потому что не заслужила. Потеряла интерес к учёбе. Врач говорит не уходить с учебного заведения. Потому что у меня и так проблемы с адаптацией, а так буду сидеть дома и все может стать ещё хуже. Что происходит с _моей_ жизнью? Или она уже не моя? Прости.	
190058	Sad	190058.jpg	Why the hell does my life have to suck that much!!!!! Why can’t I have a good or at least average life like everyone else? Why do I have to suffer so much? Why do I have to be the one struggling all the time, no matter if it is school or social life or in anything else? What did I ever do to deserve this? Did I kill someone in my past life and whatever great power wants me to suffer for that? Every single day I ask myself why there is no one that likes or loves me! My parents just care about themselves and my brother, telling me that my problems don’t matter, cause they have that many of their own. They tell me that having a depressed teenager is a bad look for the family. Especially they want a perfect daughter with the best behavior and grades. This is definitely not me! All the friends I had broken up contact. So why did you pretend to be my friend or even best friend for so many years? Did you do it to break me even more, or just because you don't care? You pretend to know me or be there for me and drop me the moment I move to a different city? Fuck you!!!! Is it so hard to find someone to be there for me and love the person I am? To find someone that is there for me and accepts all my mistakes. Why?

190115	Sad	190115.jpg	I’m saturated with emotions, Can’t handle this anymore. I’m longing to scream- Scream out my pain, Scream out the bitter truths, Scream out the wrongs my eyes see. But I fear That they’ll not respond, Hearing my deafening scream Which will numb there ears, Numb there senses; And I’ll yet be unheard. So I’ll just stay quiet Quiet with the tumult inside me. Quiet with my agony corroding my body, underneath my skin. Quiet. And no one will ever know Anything. Just nothing. -via _______

190535	Sad	190535.jpg	9/18/17 I’ve been really depressed and I lack the friends to talk to because they have lost the time for me and that makes me even more depressed. To keep me busy, I’ve been working on Halloween costumes and decorations. Made this cool liyyle eye wreath that I will add to later on once I get the supplies. More importantly, I got my Reaper mask in for my boyfriend and I added some see-through fabric to the empty spaces to give it a darker and scarier look. I ended up cutting myself two days ago and I’m ashamed of it, but I needed it to feel in control. Need to find all my long sleeves again to hide it for a little while. Tomorrow I plan to shower (I haven’t showered in 4 days) and try and get back into working out after about a week and a half of not working out. I feel horrible. Try to send some love and support if you can, I need something to boost me back up.

193160	Sad	193160.jpg	August 5th 2017 I love you so much. Never forget that. Anything I do is not because you’re not enough, but because I am trying to hold on and keep going for us. It is hard without you here and thats just how it is. I don’t like that life isn’t fair to us but gives other people who don’t deserve it, all the best things. Why are we being outcasted? I just want a happy ever after. I’ve waited my entire life to be happy, for once, and not have it taken away from me the second I believe it might be different. And what I’m asking for is not a lot. Just one person to be mine forever and to hold her and show her how wonderful and beautiful she truly is. My life has been mostly pain with some good memories, but never anything to take the inner sadness away. It’s all I’ve ever known and I don’t know how to make it stop or how to keep it from effecting myself and my life. I guess I am just weak. But I want to be strong like my girl. She inspires me to keep going no matter how bad I feel. Why is asking for someone to love me here and to be close together and not have to worry about not being with one another, so hard for God to understand? To know how painful it is and for me to watch everyone else be happy with their soulmate and have to cry myself to sleep at night wishing she was beside me. To hold me, kiss me, to cuddle one another. Maybe I’ll never know why?but just knowing could help me change and do the right thing for once in my life. I don’t get how people live their entire life in this much pain and suffering. Always miserable and sad. They are probably the strongest people out there, to keep breathing, for whatever the reason may be. Could I please have what I never could keep? To be happy with the woman I love and the woman that loves me? I guess that’s too much to ask. It’s too much to keep. Because I don’t deserve someone like her. I deserve dirt and ashes and she deserves the sun and the moon. I will never stop loving her. I will always think of her. She will always be my jelly bean. My soulmate. No matter how tomorrow goes. I love Brittany ?xx Forever ? Love, Teddy Bear

Common sense, among those who work inside the state, is a rare commodity. Agents of the state, like those who work in law enforcement, often become so blinded to reality by ‘just doing my job?they throw logic and reason to the wayside, choosing authority and force instead. Nothing highlights this blind order following quite like police tormenting a five-year-old girl and issuing her a citation for the crime of selling lemonade without a permit. More:

Our soul is the most important thing we have. It is who we are. Feed it. Nurture it. Be that. Then share THAT. The false self is who we’ve projected outward in the past.

194459	Sad	194459.jpg	Spent the day at the cemetery to pray for my mom and dad at their gravesite and then went to the infant section where my sister’s son is buried who died at birth. She also recently lost her 26 year old son who served in the USMC to addiction 2 months ago. It was very sobering seeing all the infant baby gravestones and all the little things the parents left behind for their little ones who never had a chance at life. It was so very sad I couldn’t help but shed a tear for the infants and their parents especially the mothers. (at Cemetery of The Holy Rood)

194487	Sad	194487.jpg	My baby died yesterday?From hepatitis and pancreatitis, she was on a lot of medicines for the past 6 weeks. But her little, weak body couldn’t bear more, she stopped eating, drunk a lot of water but later only vomited, she slept a lot, and yesterday at 0230 am she started dying, and after almost 5 hours she was gone and my heart with her. She had previous owners, they mistreated her, fed poorly and without care, get her pregnant a lot and when she was “worn out?they sell her to me. They also said that cat is like 3,5 y/o but her health certificate said she was born in 2010 and i’ve got her in 2016 so again lies and lots of crap from people. I hoped for couple happy years with her. She was so nice, mature but sweet and she loved to headbutt me and kiss me and she purred so sweetly, oh word, her purr was so good, it was like “finally all is fine, im happy? But from the start a lot of things were not good - she was too fat from shitty food, had a lot of excess skin from pregnancies, runny and smelly poo, and he vomited from time to time. We have been in constant touch with vet, gave her the best food, and medicines and one day she started to feel better, poo was more solid, she stopped vomiting and became my sweet, happy, fatty cat. It has stayed like that for 9-10 months, and then she started vomiting a lot, stopped eating and her skin became yellow. We took her to the vet - diagnose: hepatitis - we will fight it. But it turns out after ultrasound scan and blood test that the problem is bigger than we thought. She was sick all that time she was with us and it was because of her previous owners and their way of feeding her shitty food (for cats, dogs and even humans). I will not describe how she looked after all injections and all because it breaks my heart but the worst thing is - she died in pain because we haven’t got any painkillers from vet? But the worst of the worst is the fact that that bitch that was her previous owner (or rather daughter of owners) became vet and my mother met her at the clinic. LIKE WHAT THE FUCK! DIE BITCH!
