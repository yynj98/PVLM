56	Angry	56.jpg	Allow me to rant for a minute. I‚Äôve been seeing this post a lot on Facebook over the last few days, and the more I see it, the more angry I get. You might say,‚Äòwell, why would you get angry?? I‚Äôll tell you exactly why this post makes me angry. (Usually I don‚Äôt share my opinion with the public, so I‚Äôm allowing it this one time.) This post makes me angry because it is literally NONE of your damn businesses how many people someone has slept with. Not in the last day, not in the last week, year, or century. It just IS NOT your business. Do you plan on being in a relationship with that person? Well, by all means, go for it, but the number of people they have slept with really doesnt matter AT ALL as long as they are being safe and using whatever protection they can. (Yes, this does include being honest about any possible STD‚Äôs, but otherwise? No.) Does your best friend enjoy a number of one night stands in a month? Does your least favorite person in the universe enjoy being with one person and one person ever? AWESOME. Leave them be and quit bothering them about how many fuckin people they have slept with. TL;DR- If it‚Äôs not your body, why the hell do you care?

So thank you, certain people, for being so disrespectful, rude, and heartless to a wonderful woman. You can rest easy knowing at least something pretty came from your ugly behavior. So here. Have my flowers of rage.

219	Angry	219.jpg	[New Post] Changing Faces The Walter Scott decision is fresh in our memory but the bottom line is the the names, hash-tags & faces constantly change. But the emotions are pretty much the same. It‚Äôs overwhelming. It‚Äôs disappointing. But it‚Äôs explainable. The American government‚Äôs expression of judicial oversight & public safety isn‚Äôt broken. It‚Äôs smoothly operating the way it was designed to. And all this on the heels of the anniversary of the 13th amendment‚Äôs ratification which, in theory, was designed to serve kinda like text message auto-correct but only for the U.S. constitution. But sadly this auto-correct fail is a viral deadly meme that inundates many with names, hashtags & Changing Faces. I find it fitting that Jesus understood that race, gender & injustice were toxic instruments used to facilitate the Roman government‚Äôs rule whose currency was fear & murder. But the approach he used to challenge his followers to outgrow religious obsolesce & civic tradition is worth consideration. Jesus compassionately ignited a revolution of liberation from sin & reconciliation to our creator. This was a countercultural movement were a follower‚Äôs love for God was played out in daily life with their neighbors. To Jesus compassion was confrontational, it required followers to confront their self-interest to make serving their neighbors a priority. Early Christianity, exploded from a embryonic Jewish sect to a widely accepted faith, in one generation, because followers made very little distinctions in social mobility, outward appearance, wealth, education, age or gender. The leadership of Jesus courageously challenged his followers to mature past the the race, gender & class guidelines of traditional Roman society. To Jesus compassion wasn‚Äôt passive either, it required action. Jesus never intended for his followers to assimilate into an unjust Roman society that refused to affirm the dignity of all its citizens. Their conversion & daily commitment to their neighbors served as a public protest to the spiritual, social & personal ills of daily life. Their position of action over apathy not only acknowledged the existence of a heavenly father but it revealed his loving character to their neighbors who were previously unaware of it. Jesus & his followers discovered relevance as their actions dismantled the social & personal challenges faced by their neighbors who lived on the margins of Roman society. And it‚Äôs where I believe we find our relevance. We must develop the clarity, humanity & resolve to fight with our neighbors who live daily life on the margins of American society.

Tony is best at containing Hulk but can be easily distracted from his duties. Clint has been mostly banned from this as he ‚Äòaccidentally?encourages shenanigans in the name of 'the possibilities? At least with Thor the damage is fairly localized. Hulk isn‚Äôt exactly 'good with authority?but Steve can usually get the job done. Natasha is still better at Bruce-duty. It‚Äôs a work in progress.

2436	Angry	2436.jpg	WALK CYCLE with Emotion (week 4): Angry üé• Program used: Cinema 4D After making the basic walk cycle we had to choose an emotion and make a walk cycle showing it. The emotion I chose was angry. In order do create this walk cycle I had to ‚Äúdelete?one of the 5 stages of the walk cycle, the contact pose. When someone‚Äôs angry their knees go up a lot more and then stomp on the floor with a lot of energy and the torso is leaning forward, so this emotion is conveyed better. Therefore, there‚Äôs no contact pose. To show this angry emotion better I also made the camera shake (vibration Tag) to exaggerate the scene and turned the character red, as this color is often associated with the angry emotion. I found it really challenging to make this walk cycle. I started with the basic walk cycle and then started transforming it into a angry one, but when I realized I had to change the timing of each pose it was so much more difficult! Yet! Here it is :) Here you have a Gif of both side and front view of the angry walk cycle and after some pictures of the Down Pose, Passing Pose and Up Pose.Cheers,Iris

This is ridiculous and unacceptable, especially the fact that it‚Äôs labeled ‚Äútrend.?The fact that Walmart would even CONSIDER (let alone actually produce and sell) a product with this misogynistic message says A LOT about the company and it‚Äôs view of women. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs supposed to be funny. Even as a joke ‚Äúgo back to the kitchen?or ‚Äúmake me a sandwich?humor is over done and boring, no longer even surprising to those of us who have heard it again and again. ‚ÄúHur I‚Äôm so cool, I dismiss women and then order them to do my bidding.?because that‚Äôs so funny.

3441	Angry	3441.jpg	If you ever reblog this post and I see that you have, I will no doubt unfollow you. I HATE this post SO much. My little brother has and uses this EVERYDAY. It is a blessing for us because who wants to change a 9 year old‚Äôs diaper 4 or more times a day? My little brother is special needs, and as his big sister I‚Äôve become something of a hawk watching over him. He doesn‚Äôt walk or talk or feed himself and is basically a 9 month old baby in a 9 year old body. We have to carry him everywhere and you can imagine the amount of stares we get. So when I see people making fun of things like this, my blood boils. You reblog this post and I‚Äôm following you, we‚Äôre going to have a problem.

3852	Angry	3852.jpg	Look at that photo. That is my ceiling. I am pissed. Let me just write this down and get it out of my system because I have invitations to buy, things to do, and work to attend to. Crabs in a bucket can easily escape from a bucket one at a time, but instead of doing that they pull each other down whenever one rises to the top - thus insuring their collective demise. This is analogous to the behavior of a person who diminishes or pulls down anyone else who achieves or is about to achieve success greater than their own. I find it so stupid how people say they want you to go far in life?but not too far. Be successful just not too successful. We all like to see our friends go ahead but not too far ahead. It‚Äôs stupid. If I was good at something, I want to be able to teach someone who is willing and hopefully make them better than me. When they‚Äôre great it‚Äôs because I made them that way. I should be proud. None of the crab mentality shit. But some people are just selfish and ignorant and ugh, they just piss me off so much. Ungrateful. Self-centered. Shallow. Ugh.

Rather than trying to hide ‚Äúnegative? behind poorly placed bypassing phrases like ‚ÄòLove n Light? and becoming hijacked by such, they allow them to flow, and let them go. A ChaosHugger actively chooses their own inner state, and although they understand the necessity to visit other states whilst being human, they ALWAYS come home to their chosen state of being!

7875	Angry	7875.jpg	¬´ Le conflit ¬ª J‚Äôai voulu mettre en sc√®ne une situation de rupture amoureuse dans un cadrage inspir√© du Western, comme pour les sc√®nes de r√®glement de compte (un personnage de face de plein pied et un autre de dos, face √† l‚Äôautre, vu √† demi). J‚Äôai coup√© le fond en deux comme pour faire un paysage de d√©sert, mais aussi pour accentuer l‚Äôeffet de ¬´ s√©paration ¬ª. J‚Äôai choisi des teintes vives et tranch√©es car j‚Äôaime ce genre de mise en couleur ou l‚Äôon distingue clairement chaque √©l√©ment, dans un style assez peu r√©aliste, avec des formes simples et lin√©aires. Ici c‚Äôest plut√¥t dans un souci esth√©tique personnel que j‚Äôai travaill√© la couleur ainsi. J‚Äôai choisi de rajouter une r√©plique √† chaque personnage pour bien illustrer le propos du dessin : le ¬´ End. ¬ª affirm√© qui signifie la fin d‚Äôune histoire, et la r√©ponse ¬´ And ? ¬ª qui pourrait soulever le fait que √ßa ne soit pas r√©ellement la fin (qu‚Äôil y ai une suite) ou au contraire l‚Äôinsolence et la manifestation d‚Äôun manque d‚Äôint√©r√™t qui signifierait r√©ellement la fin.

11089	Angry	11089.jpg	New Post has been published on Why Its Seriously Dangerous To Exercise Angry (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push(); (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push(); Many of us struck the health club to allow off heavy steam. Yet brand-new study recommends that if you‚Äôre upset or dismayed, you might intend to relax prior to doing an extreme exercise. A brand-new Canadian research study has actually located that integrating hefty physical effort with a stressed out or distressed mood places you at virtually a 3 times a better danger of a cardiovascular disease. The research from McMaster University in Hamilton, Ont. was released in the journal Circulation on Monday, as well as assessed information from 12,461 individuals experiencing a very first cardiovascular disease in 52 nations. After their cardiovascular disease, individuals were asked if they would certainly taken part in hefty physical effort and/or if they had actually been mad or mentally disturbed in the hr prior to their signs started. Scientists located that hefty physical effort paired with a severe emotion greater than tripled the danger of having a cardiovascular disease. The research regulated for a variety of variables, consisting of individuals?smoking cigarettes condition, body mass index, high blood pressure degrees, heart-related drugs, sex as well as age ?the writers located no substantial distinction in between age (under 45, 45 to 65, or over 65) or in between males and females. Barry J. Jacobs, supervisor of behavior scientific researches at the Crozer-Keystone Family Medicine Residency Program in Springfield, Pennsylvania, claims the research (which he was not associated with) supplies more proof of the web link in between body and mind. ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre upset, that‚Äôs not the moment to head out as well as cut a pile of timber,?stated Jacobs. ‚ÄúAll of us need to exercise psychological health as well as prevent shedding our mood to extremes.? Routine workout, obviously, is incredibly helpful for you. It avoids tension, heart problem as well as a variety of various other disorders. The most significant issue is that the majority of us do not obtain sufficient of it. For very psychological people with a high danger of cardiac arrest, the consolidation of yoga exercise?with its concentrate on breathing, reflection and also leisure ?may be specifically useful. Team workout courses in a social setup might likewise fend off sensations of severe temper. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push();

My animal instinct tells me I should run from all my worries and pains I may not have eyes but I have a beating heart and a brain And it‚Äôs taking every fiber of my being to keep sane Trying to stop myself from going back into the abyss Screaming at the mirror until my ears bleed that things will be okay like this The water comes up to my knees But I‚Äôm bleeding out, asking God please Help me! Don‚Äôt let me drown in this sorrow Lend me your eyes to borrow I need a moment of clarity to understand Find myself a foothold in which to stand I want to live and not just be breathing I‚Äôve always been a lone wolf hunting and surviving Licking my wounds and tucking my tail between my legs At least I‚Äôve never been a dog that begs I did my part, tried to change into something I‚Äôm not Giving everything that I‚Äôve got So I‚Äôm done, I‚Äôll no longer wait, I can‚Äôt anymore I‚Äôm a wolf with fangs that has already tore Into your heart, into your soul I hope that it will leave a deep, dark, hole When you‚Äôve left me so scared and alone I will pray that he leaves you, so you will have known The same pain that I have felt The same pain that makes you kneel where I have knelt Forgive me for speaking my mind Or seeming so unkind I promise my heart‚Äôs still there Still bruised and broken somewhere Inside this poorly drawn up boy Who was nothing more to you than just a toy

12845	Angry	12845.jpg	I‚Äôm not sharing this post for any reason other than therapy for myself and to show how situations can affect your life and cause you to make life changing decisions. Today is the day to find out what‚Äôs going to take place with my prosthetic right knee and when. Many emotions are running through my mind right now. The initial surgery went horribly wrong with infection setting in during surgery. They had to reopen the wound and use what‚Äôs called a wound vac to extract all of the infection and then do a skin graft to close the gaping hole that was left after the removal of the infection. I spent months in the hospital, learned to walk again, my life had to give me shots in my stomach and give my medicine through a pic line. Why? Because DPD didn‚Äôt wanna continue to pay the hospital bill they sent me home and sent a home nurse only twice a week for care. All people hear is the bad news you about officers, you never hear (or hardly ever) about us that give our lives, get injured and the department turning there backs on us. Moving forward, now that my prosthetic has become detached from the bone the department says I‚Äôm on my own, so much for putting my life on the line for 15 years, almost dying at the scene and later dealing with all of this. Mad, angry, disgusted are just a few words I‚Äôm thinking, there‚Äôs others believe me. So whatever comes next is on me (my family), but I was forced to retire with a duty disability retirement. Which now I know to mean ZERO insurance coverage for this ON DUTY injury. This here is real life *hit and the crazy thing is I‚Äôd do that job again, I miss it to this day. I look at my leg and I can‚Äôt even do things with my kids like my dad did with me. That hurts a lot. (at Great Lakes Surgical Center LLC)

How the fuck are we having Asian/Asian American groups and organizations with white saviors at the helm? That doesn‚Äôt make sense. I‚Äôm not saying you can‚Äôt have white members, contributers, or whatnot. But the face should always be an Asian/Asian American if it‚Äôs an Asian/Asian American group or organization, period. And I understand having white investors and shit because sometimes you need money to operate and one way or another you gotta take it from a rich white person. But still, this pisses me off. How do we uplift ourselves if we aren‚Äôt the ones doing it ourselves? Maybe I‚Äôm just jumping to conclusions and assumptions because seeing this shit pisses me off but the anger is still pretty justified, right? On a side note, if this is true of your organization, group, or whatnot, please overthrow their colonizing asses during your next organization‚Äôs elections or whatnot lmao. Angry Asian Guy

14139	Angry	14139.jpg	Hello! I am late posting again today. Oh well, who‚Äôs keeping tally!? There are no smoke signals or even pictures of pretty origami peace cranes today for my meditation was rushed. Instead you get pictures of my morning snuggle time when all was joyful and sunny and I had all the time in the word to do what I needed to do. Though I totally rushed my meditation, I did manage to scribble a prayer on my tiny red crane for the day before I rushed off to some distant destination?it was a prayer (and still is) to embrace my angry emotions and use them for fuel ‚õΩÔ∏è for my love fire. I feel strongly that our emotions are meant to teach us things in the moment, but that they aren‚Äôt meant to stay stuck like they so often do. For those of you that know me professionally, you might find it surprising that I experience anger. You might know me best as ‚ÄúJoy?or a tony fairy princess?Most days that I get angry, it‚Äôs about the little things. They add up, ya know? When I start sounding like a broken record and feel as though I am not being heard, I start to freak out. Other times when I get angry, I think it‚Äôs just misunderstood sadness from situations where I wanted to be helpful but where my help isn‚Äôt well received or goes unappreciated for long periods of time. So, today I let something small and insignificant get a hold of me and make me feel angry and needing to vent for a couple of hours (thank you boyfriend, thank you friends for being that listening ear). Now, I am over that feeling and instead moving forward with deeper love, understanding and a stronger commitment to do whatever the f*** it is I need to do to keep this girl happy. My joy is worthy of being shared and there‚Äôs no point in me holding on to anger that holds me back from that. Watch out world üåé

Fondly she recalled the days when her energy was spent flying, spiralling through the air. Everything was so simple then. She never thought that her play would lead into training. She, like everyone else, had to fight to protect her city from the outagers. The black-outs they caused; entire neighbourhoods went dark and stayed dark. Communications went down. Tech failed again and again. Aria lost her ability to fly; she had to walk to the Last City. The people welcomed her but in the same way they welcomed any survivor- with worry. She took her seat on the counsel as the daughter of the former air king. Aria knew they needed concrete plans to rebuild their society.

I know I‚Äôm stupid for giving you endless chances but I just don‚Äôt think a part of me wants to let you go, not yet. I think a part of me is hopelessly waiting for you to finally mean it when you tell me you feel the same way about me as I do about you and I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôll always be like that when it comes to you, helplessly dreaming for the day when you wake up and realise that I‚Äôm the one you want to be with.

Melentha the underworld Demi-god is known as 'The Judge?or the one who decides if you deserve to go to the Aether realm or go to the underworld. Sometimes if she doesn‚Äôt care she‚Äôll throw you into purgatory to deal with later. Also they both have space hair. Arela‚Äôs is mostly cool colors and Melentha‚Äôs is mostly warm colors.

29615	Bored	29615.jpg	I traveled for almost 10 hours yesterday. on my 5 hour flight both my phone and computer died. I journaled ten pages and fished the book I brought with me. then I just sat. both strangers sitting next to me were asleep. I couldn‚Äôt listen to a podcast. I had nothing left to let out in my journal. I couldn‚Äôt work. I couldn‚Äôt listen to music or a podcast. The plane had no TVs or outlets. I was completely alone with my own thoughts. even the snacks I had accidentally got thrown away so I couldn‚Äôt turn to food to cope with my uncomfortable feelings. I just sat there. I put on my sunglasses even though the plane was dark. I meditated. I cried a little. I tried to sleep. then all that was left was boredom. something I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve felt since the early 2000s and something I‚Äôve made myself too busy to feel in the last 6 years. It‚Äôs hard to be bored at home when there‚Äôs Netflix. It‚Äôs hard to be bored in line when there‚Äôs iPhones. I realized how important boredom is for me, how always trying to be productive is my addiction, and how presence is a skill I need a lot of practice at. *** „Ä∞Ô∏èüì∑: for his zine volume 1 ?type by \ (at Detroit, Michigan)

Ich bin krank geschrieben und wurde einige Male gefragt was ich denn habe, was sagt man darauf? Auf den Krankenscheinen steht meist Psychose. Ich darf nicht feiern oder √§hnliches, weil ich krank geschrieben bin und deshalb verl√§uft mein Leben neben mir und ich schaue alten Freunden, Freunden und meinem Freund dabei zu wie sie ihr Leben genie√üen und ich warte bis ich meins wieder Leben darf.

44024	Bored	44024.jpg	11.02.18: My own fucking sweet wonderland. ‚ÄúI walk in small steps, heavy doses. Head down so you never notice. Headphones on, a quiet song Try to block it out, it‚Äôs so hard to focus. I get lost in those tiny moments And slowly start to breathe. Those words hurt, but I know that I‚Äôm not broken until I bleed.?# Cut Me Out - Dangerkids Marcel war etwas besonders. Er war nie der Junge auf den die Frauen flogen oder den alle um irgendetwas beneideten, wenn man das gewollt h√§tte, dann auf seine F√§higkeit nicht aufzufallen und mit der Welt um sich herum zu verschmelzen. W√ºrde er in zehn Jahren auf einem Klassentreffen auftauchen, w√ºrde niemand ihn erkennen, er w√ºrde seinen Namen sagen und die Blicke der Menschen w√ºrden ihm zeigen das sie keine Ahnung haben wer er ist, woraufhin irgendwer anfangen w√ºrde mit ‚ÄúJaaaaaa, heeeeeeeeeey Marcel, du warst doch der Dude der..?gefolgt von einem langen schweigen. Es gab keine Geschichten √ºber Marcel, auch wenn ihn das gest√∂rt hatte, war es doch etwas gutes. Wer nicht auff√§llt, kann auch nicht negativ auffallen. Er war nicht der Typ der st√§ndig von allen f√ºr sein √úbergewicht geh√§nselt wurde, nicht derjenige der sich nach jeder Probe anh√∂ren durfte was er doch f√ºr ein Streber ist, er war einfach.. vorhanden. Er hatte sich abgefunden mit seinem dasein, auch wenn er sich bewusst war, dass die Einsamkeit ihn langsam zerfra√ü. Menschen stellen sich viele Fragen im Leben, ‚ÄúWas ich wohl mal beruflich mache??oder ‚ÄúWas ich denn tun muss das XY auf mich steht?? nicht Marcel, die einzige Frage die er sich Nacht f√ºr Nacht unter Tr√§nen stellte war: ‚ÄúExistiere ich √ºberhaupt?? Nicht dumm, denn genau so war es, er war wie eine -0 in der gro√üen Gleichung von vielen Leben, er machte nichts besser, aber wenigstens auch nichts schlechter. ‚ÄúMy concrete‚Äôs set, it‚Äôs permanent. I‚Äôm stuck this way, now I can never change. No, I can‚Äôt stop if all I‚Äôve got Is an empty heart full of broken parts.?# Concrete - As It is feat. Ansley Newman (Acoustic Version) Es sollte aber nicht immer so bleiben. Das Leben √§nderte sich, pl√∂tzlich gab es Menschen die ihn sehen konnten. Menschen die erkannten, dass er ein gutes Herz hatte, freundlich war, zuvorkommend und lustig. Sie waren gl√ºcklich in seiner N√§he, nur erkannten sie nicht, dass das nur f√ºr sie galt. Marcel wusste das er gemocht wurde, auf einmal essentiel war und es jemand gab die gern in seiner N√§he waren, aber es √§nderte nichts. Die Freuden die ihm zuteil wurden waren zuviel f√ºr ihn, Verlust√§ngste brannten Narben in seine Seele, immer und immer und immer wieder, das schon bei jeder Kleinigkeit. Er konnte nicht anders, er war dieses Gef√ºhl Unsichtbar zu sein so sehr leid. Marcel h√§tte alles getan um gewisse Menschen an seiner Seite zu behalten und griff zu √ºbertriebenen Mitteln. Sie gingen, jeder einzelne, wieder und wieder. Nutzlos, ungen√ºgend, Hoffnungslos, es war nicht schwer zu begreifen, dass er die Personifikation dieser Eigenschaften war, aber Marcel gab nicht auf, er wollte besser sein, er wollte sich √§ndern aber seine √Ñngste zu versagen hielten ihn zur√ºck. Eifersucht beherrschte sein Leben, Neid zerm√ºrbte seine Freundschaften. Egal wer es war, er wusste, dass die Person vor ihm ihn nicht verstehen kann, selbst wenn sie es doch gekonnt h√§tte, also ging er. Verschloss sich mit dem Wahnsinn seiner selbst, der sein einziger Freund werden sollte. Heute wartet er, worauf ist ihm nicht klar, aber er wartet, denn Marcel ist immer noch besonders. ‚ÄúI think I lost my mind a while ago ‚ÄòCause I‚Äôve been seeing some ghosts And I‚Äôd be lying if I told you I‚Äôm fine But I lie.?# drowning. - The Eden Project

47541	Calm	47541.jpg	Continuing on the theme of colour, today I pulled lovely turquoise. A particular favourite colour of mine so happy to see it come up. An easy colour to wear and to look at and perfect on so many fronts. If you‚Äôre ever faced with public speaking or just don‚Äôt like being the centre of attention or in a crowd, then turquoise is the colour for you. The green held within it will balance and calm as will the blue. The blue within the turquoise will calm, cool and help you to speak, so you can see how this colour could be helpful. Besides the above, the colour of turquoise is linked with the thymus and with the immune system, so a lovely way to give some support to that. So if you need refreshing, uplifting, cooling, calming, to overcome fear of speaking publicly, turquoise is the colour to use. Not an easy colour to eat :-) but introduce it into your life with your clothes, accessories, d√©cor, artwork, meditate on it. Use whatever way comes to mind to get a shot of this beautiful colour. It‚Äôll serve you well. The card is from The Secret Language of Colour by Inna Segal, the scarf is mine :-) Enjoy turquoise, enjoy all the colour of the rainbow. Colour your life, colour your health and wellbeing.

She did pretty well. All our meltdowns revolved around our morning outing and the rest of the day at home has been a lot calmer. Today was a success. We are also starting a new medication tonight that has the potential to help her sleep thru the night. She and I are also moving to the basement and will sleep down there and see if being in a cooler environment will help her as well. sorry mom if this works you have to sleep in her room lol) Yay!

48728	Calm	48728.jpg	This was the meditation on January 23 right after I‚Äôd finished praying that God would help me to find the grace to forgive myself for the things in my past that I still hold onto. The thing is that even while I hold onto those old things, I acknowledge how they made me better and how I‚Äôm able to have the things that I do today because of those things. It‚Äôs sort of like I‚Äôm talking out of two sides of my mouth. I know that these experiences have ultimately beneficial?but I still look at them as a burden that I‚Äôm forced to live with for the rest of my life. The reality of it is, though, that that‚Äôs really just all in the way that I look at it. I hold onto things so tightly because I feel like I am cursed with carrying them. I fancied myself like Atlas from Greek Mythology, condemned to carry the weight of the world on his shoulders. But really, that‚Äôs just the way that I‚Äôm choosing to view it. I think that deep down I know this too?that‚Äôs why I‚Äôd been praying the specific way that I was. I‚Äôm holding onto things and carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders because I can‚Äôt find it in me to forgive myself. I am still looking at my past as a failure, not as a gift. It‚Äôs time to change my perspective. I‚Äôm bad at receiving gifts. I don‚Äôt like when people look at me to watch me open something because I know that they‚Äôre waiting for my emotional reaction and I‚Äôm going to have the wrong one. Which is actually probably the perfect analogy for the way I handle dealing with my past?I‚Äôm receiving a gift but I‚Äôm going to have the wrong emotion attached to receiving it. Yay! I‚Äôm a work in progress, I know that. Forgiving myself is not something I‚Äôm good at (oh hello, long lasting ramifications of emotional abuse? and it‚Äôs something that I‚Äôm very, very slowly working on. There are days when I feel like I‚Äôm making huge strides and then there are days when I just can‚Äôt get over my past failures. But if I can manage to change my perspective and start looking at things as gifts rather than failures, I think I might finally be able to take that step toward forgiveness. KTBSPA! -Lindsey

49594	Calm	49594.jpg	The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked, who can know it. (Jeremiah 17:9) People with an evil heart strive on the pain they cause others. They have no concern about who get hurts, as long as their desires are met (Proverbs 2: 14-15; Isaiah 32: 6) They have no concern about what their smooth speech and flattering words will cause; all they are concern with is accomplishing their end goal (Psalms 36:1-4) People that have an evil heart will try to twist the facts, mislead others, are not afraid of telling lies, they do not take responsibility for their actions, and even will withhold valuable information (Psalms 10:7 58:3) But when grace is shown to the wicked, they do not learn righteousness; even in a land of uprightness they go on doing evil and do not regard the majesty of the Lord (Isaiah 26:10) Therefore these people should be dealt with (1 Corinthians 5:6)

49775	Calm	49775.jpg	An interesting article we have hanging in the yoga studio most of the time a good balanced yoga practice leaves you feeling clear, focused and calm‚Ä¶but there are the other times when our practice can stir things up - like feelings that were stuck in the body that we never fully processed. We all have these less than pleasant memories and feelings that can come up in some parts of the practice or meditation. The path of Self Study (Svadyaya) will sometimes point to areas where we are stuck & our attention is needed - which is not an easy process. The key here is to watch the experience - notice everything without pushing it away - and be kind to yourself when you see these difficult things rising up (selfcare)- dont push yourself too far too fast (in both the physical and the emotional aspect of your practice) progress is made a little at a time. This helps us to cultivate patience on our healing journey - and then we may be able to exercise more patience when interacting with others as well! (at Hummingbird Yoga NJ)

49882	Calm	49882.jpg	Calmness We have so much stress every day. Okay, I will not generalize. I have, though I am sure that many will agree. The transition from the state of wow, what a sun wow I love this life, to what‚Äôs going on, kill me - may take 15 minutes. I know that I take everything to close to heart, that I can quickly lose my temper, get upset, but also become happy, cheer up. I always wanted to overcome this, or at least take this function under my control. Maybe this is a spring aggravation, but lately, I‚Äôve been influenced too much by the world around me, it‚Äôs not important it‚Äôs people, circumstances, a spilled cup of tea. The absolute little thing can spoil the mood for the whole day. And in fact, the main thing in this is that this is an absolute trifle. And the way we live our day, how we feel is not a trifle at all, but it‚Äôs super important. From these days the whole life is made up. It is clear that in today‚Äôs world with thousands of opportunities for tears or laughter, smiles or hatred and anger it is very difficult to remain absolutely calm. It seems to me that only few can do this. And after all, I want to maintain this inner harmony, which depends only on how we adjust ourselves, from our own worldview. For me it has been a dilemma how to remain calm and balanced inside, while feeling the world to the smallest of notes, to feel and notice everything. This is a very fine line, as for me. Between an uncontrolled hysterical woman and an unfeeling passive ameba. But I set myself the goal to find this balance, balancing my inner self. Stop responding to everything, to distinguish small unimportance from actual problems. Do not be led by human selfishness, stupidity, narcissism. We ourselves are in control over our life, over what comes in our head. So you need to use this function. Clean out the inner world from unnecessary cockroaches and enjoy the spring sun and greenery around.

Yoga has become such a powerful tool for so many, I want to do everything in my power to capture imagery that conveys yogas meditative properties, its healing power and it‚Äôs calming of the mind body and spirit. I shot this yesterday while being mesmerized by the dancing sunset light upon the water.

Golden and warm, it calms and soothes gives life and inspires, I found it fitting that the water was a sort of transfer point from the sun to water to human.

Asked kids to write down all thoughts before any meditation or breathing work began. And then we did 3 rounds of breathing exercises and asked to turn the page and write what thoughts they had in mind some had 2 thoughts or none thoughts just so calm and peace. These kids are around 7 yrs till 11yrs old.. if this is what happens with calm breathing of few seconds and mindful activity, imagine how much more we will be ourselves with these toolsüíñüíóüêíüêµüêíüêµüêµüêí

If you‚Äôre enjoying this, please visit our site for more inspirational articles. Setting a strong foundation ?repetition, repetition, repetition. One of the most effective ways to increase your performance in anything is simply by turning up and practicing! This may sound extremely obvious but it can be discounted far too often. Some people want all the glory but are not willing to put in the time to achieve it. So repetition, repetition, repetition cannot be overlooked as it‚Äôs the cornerstone of executing the task in hand. Moving practice to performance With a strong foundation in practice, our next task is to convert that to the match or performance. A classic example is the musician. They practice for many years in their bedroom to then hopefully one day play to hundreds or thousands of people. Their next step is to then move that playing to the stage. The paradox of performance Let‚Äôs just quickly address one area that can cause many people to trip over when trying to perform at their best. Always wanting to perform at perfect standards can cause problems if it‚Äôs not addressed and managed. We want to create an environment in which we push for our best performances, aim for a high level/standard, but have a heavy level of perspective whilst doing it. So if we have a bad day at work or at the session, we can quickly turn ourselves back around and get back to it. Taking off the pressure One of the most effective ways to take the pressure off yourself is to simmer the amount of focus on yourself. This is a little paradoxical, but the best way to do it is to focus on your main mission. Some performers, instead of focusing so much on themselves, switch their focus to entertain the crowd; giving them a great evening or offering a product or performance that can impact their lives. This can be especially helpful for entrepreneurs. When they focus on their overall mission, it can help keep them on track when the challenges come. It helps to alleviate the pressure THEY PUT ON THEMSELVES! So let‚Äôs take a look at ten techniques that you can apply in any pressurised situation: Visualisation ?visualisation plays a huge part for many athletes and performers. Simply put, it‚Äôs the ability to visualise the desired outcome you would like by mentally running through your performance, bit by bit. This is a great technique for many golfers, basketball players, musicians etc ?they clearly visualise the outcome they would like. A study by Edmund Jacobson proved how effective visualisation truly is with a set of basketball players. Check it out! Movement ?your physical body (the way you position your body). Resetting your posture under pressure can massively affect your performance. Take Cristiano Ronaldo‚Äôs body positioning when he steps up to take a free kick. With Ronaldo being a ‚ÄòJ?shape kicker (direction of the kick) he inputs greater power into the ball in the direction of the kick. His upright posture gives him a ‚Äòpower?stance that can also add huge mental benefits. Social psychologist Amy Cuddy has done some phenomenal work on body language and how it effects our testosterone and cortisol levels in the brain. Fascinating! Meditation ?in any pressurised situation, being able to regulate your thoughts and emotions is huge. Meditation can be a great tool to keep your emotions and impulses at bay in performance. Restful alertness is the key here: with training we become more and more aware of our thoughts and emotions. Therefore, we can respond more effectively in high performance. Language ?reframing the situation ?a healthy way to increase your performance is the way you shape the situation. Many performers still feel nerves before aperformance, but it‚Äôs how they manage and use it to their advantage that is the key. Mike Tyson before many of his boxing fights would be extremely nervous, but his coach would say: ‚ÄúThe hero and the coward both feel the same thing, but the hero uses his fear, projects it onto his opponent, while the coward runs. It‚Äôs the same thing, fear, but it‚Äôs what you do with it that matters? ‚ÄòThere are many opportunities??think about how many times you have to get it right. The band Coldplay got turned down by over 20 record companies but they kept going. You will have other opportunities if you put yourself out there and keep on being proactive. The irony is you feel less pressure knowing there will be other opportunities. These are five of many strategies you can begin to develop in your arena. Start with one and see how it can help with your development and training. Step into your greatness today!

51751	Calm	51751.jpg	The Calm Company I‚Äôll admit it, I‚Äôm a fanboy of Jason Fried and his company Basecamp. I‚Äôm always in awe after reading one of his articles, viewing one of his videos or hearing him speak on a podcast. His thoughts and opinions are clear, articulate and always make complete sense. After reading his second book ‚ÄúREWORK,?which he co-wrote with David Heinemeier Hansson, and since we began using his company‚Äôs web-based project management tool Basecamp to run all of our projects here at Block Club, I came to really admire Fried‚Äôs approach to making work as efficient as possible. That‚Äôs why I was really excited to learn about plans for the next book from Jason and David, ‚ÄúThe Calm Company.? Jason includes the introduction for the book in his blog post here. I‚Äôd love to highlight a snippet or two from the post here but, to be honest, every single sentence is worth reading. Please do yourself a favor and spend the estimated six minutes it will take to read the full article. I‚Äôm sure most, if not everyone, can relate to the problems that are outlined. Why do we often refer to the pace of our workplace as ‚Äúcrazy? I hear this all the time when talking with friends and colleagues. While this has been accepted as normal in most workplace environments these days, I don‚Äôt think that has to be the case. Avoiding distractions, knowing when to say no and saving time on your calendar every week for uninterrupted work are just a few of the items that can be done to avoid a crazy workplace atmosphere. Making your time as efficient as possible at work will also directly impact your personal time for the better. This is very important to me with two little ones at home. I want to make every minute away from them at work matter so that when I leave for the day I feel confident that my work is in a good place and so I can enjoy my time with them as much as possible. That isn‚Äôt to say that you need children at home in order to be more efficient at work. Everyone should want their time at work to be productive and to feel a sense of accomplishment at the end of the day. Keep an eye on the progress of ‚ÄúThe Calm Company?as well as confirmation on the release date here. - Steve Connect with Block Club | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | LinkedIn | Spotify

One of the best ways to lose weight and improve your skin and energy levels is to get enough restful sleep! In feng shui philosophy, the bedroom represents you and deeply affects your body and soul. At the very least we spend a handful of hour sleeping in this room. Most of that time, we‚Äôre asleep, in a passive ‚Äúyin?state, so what we have around us greatly shapes how restful and restorative sleep can be. Here are five simple ways to create a Zen sleeping space to maximize your beauty sleep!

56121	Calm	56121.jpg	The Prophet Muhammad PBUH said, ‚ÄúEvery Deen has an innate character. The character of Islam is modesty (haya).?(Abu Dawood) The Definition of Haya? Haya?comes from hayat (life). It is that which keeps you ethically and spiritually alive. Just like a body gets its value from being alive, the spirit, soul, character and person gets their value from having haya? The reality of haya?is that it is that trait which motivates you to do what is good. That same trait discourages you from doing anything shameful. It is the one quality that make Muslims stand out. Words that encompass aspects of haya? shame, humility, self-respect, honor, bashfulness, shyness The Prophet‚Äôs Statements on Haya? The Prophet (s) said, ‚ÄúFaith (Belief) consists of more than sixty branches (i.e. parts). And Haya?is a part of faith.?(Bukhari) The Prophet (s) passed by a man who was admonishing his brother regarding Haya?and was saying, ‚ÄúYou are very shy, and I am afraid that might harm you.?On that, Allah‚Äôs Apostle said, ‚ÄúLeave him, for Haya?is (a part) of Faith.?(Bukhari) Prophet (s) said: ‚ÄúHaya does not bring anything except good.?(Bukhari) Having haya?towards Allah ?a Muslim should feel ashamed to have Allah see him doing ?or hear him saying ?something that displeases Allah, especially when that Muslim is alone and out of the view of humankind. Haya?towards the angels ?as they are noble and dignified creatures who witness the acts performed by humans. Haya?towards other humans ?an essential characteristic that keeps people from harming one another and from performing indecent acts. Haya?towards the person him/herself ?a person should be ashamed of him/herself when he/she performs acts that are shameful. If he/she notices that his/her haya?level is low he/she should improve it by remembrance of Allah, getting closer to Him, and fearing Him.

56551	Calm	56551.jpg	El parque del Monasterio de Piedra El Monasterio de Piedra fue adquirido en 1843, por Don Pablo Muntadas Campeny, a trav√©s de una Subasta P√∫blica, por 1.250.000 reales. Fue en los a√±os siguientes, cuando Don Juan Federico Muntadas, hijo del anterior, transform√≥ la huerta existente en un jard√≠n paisajista, y las dependencias conventuales en una instalaci√≥n hostelera e hidroter√°pica. A ello, a√±adi√≥ la construcci√≥n de una piscifactor√≠a en 1867, que fue pionera en Espa√±a y de la que pueden verse algunas de sus pesqueras al visitar el Parque. Desde entonces hasta nuestros d√≠as, Piedra se convirti√≥ en un destino tur√≠stico de primer orden. La adquisici√≥n de la Propiedad por la familia Muntadas, la transformaci√≥n del monasterio en un Hotel y los nuevos usos tur√≠sticos que se dieron a las dependencias frenaron su degradaci√≥n, despu√©s de la desamortizaci√≥n de Mendiz√°bal en 1835, y lo han preservado como en la actualidad. El recorrido del Parque del Monasterio de Piedra est√° cuajado de sorpresas y bell√≠simos rincones de cualidades est√©ticas y paisajistas sorprendentes. A la belleza propia del r√≠o hay que a√±adir el bullicio y frescor de sus cascadas, la apacible quietud de sus lagos, en especial la del Lago del Espejo y el cantar o trineo de diferentes especies de aves, de las que se han identificado m√°s de 20 especies distintas. [monasteriopiedra.com] = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = The Monasterio de Piedra was acquired in 1843 after Mendizabal‚Äôs seizure (1835), through a public auction by Don Pablo Muntadas Campeny. In the following years, his sonDon Juan Federico Muntadas, with the help of the Piedra river that crossed the lands, transformed the existing orchard into a landscaped garden full of waterfalls and extraordinary vegetation, and the conventual buildings into a hotel and a hidrotherapic installation. The Park is a wonderful example of how sometimes the ingenuity of man and the power of nature, in this case the Piedra river and a fascinating natural geology, complement each other to create magical spaces of stunning beauty. And to this beauty, Don Juan Federico Muntadas also added the construction of the first fish farm in Spain in 1867, of which you can still see a part today, when visiting the park. From then until now, Monasterio de Piedrahas become a prime tourist destination.The overwhelming nature of the Park with itspaths and waterfalls, make of this Historic Garden a unique place in the world. Today, more than 150 years later, the Piedra river continues sculpturing the rock, and the hand of man is only responsible of keeping the place clean and safe, to ensure an absolutely unforgettable visit to everyone that comes to discover this Park.

58095	Calm	58095.jpg	Stressed out? Need some help, emotionally? Be kind to yourself. These are some things I‚Äôve done today when I was really struggling. I thought they might help others too! - sit in the sun, inside or out. Natural light can help nourish your body and your mind, especially if you‚Äôve been sitting in a dark/artificially lit place for a long time. - make sure you drink water and streatch (stay healthy!) - get a cup of tea, hot chocolate, or coffee (whatever you like) and a snack that you love. You deserve it! - if you have a stuffed animal (or animals) that you like, have it near by and cuddle it. - if you‚Äôre anxious or just fidget a lot, get yourself a toy. Tangles, fidget cubes/spinners, stress balls, etc. - pick up a book and try to read a few paragraphs. Reading can help get our minds off of what might be bothering us. But you can take it as slow as you need. Although reading can be helpful, it can also be hard to focus when we‚Äôre stressed out. Take it slow, and take breaks if you need. - watch a good show on tv (Netflix, Amazon, whatever you can access). I like Parks and Recreation, and Psych right now. Serious tv is good sometimes but when I‚Äôm upset I think something funny is nicer on my mind. I also keep many of these things (tangle, book, stuffed animal, chocolate) in my Self care box! I had a really fun time making it and I like to have it for when times are tough.	
58105	Calm	58105.jpg	Good afternoon! Happy tranquility Tuesday! We all go through storms in life be it financial, or emotional, or any other thing that happens that we can‚Äôt really control, but we can still make time for serenity. We can still find pease and tranquility. Sometimes it‚Äôs just harder. When the storms of life are happening we need to make sure to take time to gather our thoughts and accept what is happening, and then we can move forward from there. You are awesome! God knows it, and so should you!	
58107	Calm	58107.jpg	Happy Tuesday!!! My intestines are really annoying me already today so I need a good quote to motivate me. I discovered this quote and I love it. My pain may stop me from doing certain things, and pretty much being a normal 20 year old, but I‚Äôm not laid up in bed. At least I‚Äôm to accomplish some things. I believe that‚Äôs because of God. God gives me the strength to endure the pain. I refuse to allow my pain to weaken me to the point of not doing anything. I hate feeling lazy, no matter how I feel. When my pain is bad like it is currently I just remember that last year I literally couldn‚Äôt move or barely breathe. I‚Äôm one of God‚Äôs little warriors! I will make it. I will stay strong!!! üò£üòÑüí™üèªüôèüèªüíñ

K√§nslom√§ssigt hj√§lper Agaten dig att komma √∂ver negativitet och bitterhet. Den l√§ker inre ilska, fr√§mjar k√§rlek och mod att b√∂rja om igen.

60120	Calm	60120.jpg	It‚Äôs early-March and we can already feel the delicate footsteps of spring coming closer. Regardless of the moody weather that often conceals the first signs of green and warmth, the beginning of spring shifts something in us. It‚Äôs a wake-up call, holding the transformative power to help us expand our inner world and deepen the connection within ourselves. A great way to achieve that connection is by dedicating a moment each day to ground ourselves. This will strengthen the balance that often escapes us. Feeling more centred not only help us cope with built-up stress and daily challenges, but also brings us clarity, long-time needed peace, and answers to the worries that keep us awake at night. Here you can find the best techniques that will help you feel more balanced. Check out our article via the link below: I hope your day is full of love!

What goes on in your mind is invisible, undetectable to other people. But I read your thoughts continually, searching for evidence of trust in Me. I rejoice when your mind turns toward Me. Guard your thoughts diligently; good thought-choices will keep you close to Me. Search me, O God, and know my heart; try me and know my anxious thoughts; and see if there be any hurtful way in me, and lead me in the everlasting way. ‚ÄîPsalm 139:23?4 nasb

60923	Calm	60923.jpg	Hi everyone! As promised, I‚Äôm back with a new spell jar for Peace Of Mind which is something I could definitely do with at the moment. Life hasn‚Äôt been the easiest recently but this jar has given me a boost and - in combination with the meditation I‚Äôve recently been trying (because the Headspace app is amazing!) - I‚Äôm feeling a lot better. Hopefully this jar will help some of you too! The ingredients for the Peace Of Mind Jar are below: Apple (seeds and peel) - healing, happiness, peace of mind Himalayan salt - protection Basil - promotes peace Bay leaf - protection, healing Cardamom - calmness, tranquillity Juniper berries - protection, purification, healing Orange (peel) - harmony, peace, stability Mint (peppermint is best) - healing, love, purification I sealed the jar with pale grey wax for cool, neutral, balanced energy. (I added bonus star sequins because, let‚Äôs face it, they can only make things better, right?!) As always, I would love to see any spell jars you come up with so please remember to tag me in any posts. Sending love and positivity to my wonderful followers. - Katy

61359	Calm	61359.jpg	Tabby‚Äôs wonderful testimonial ‚ÄúMy personal CBD dog treat testimony? (my pup has seizures) My Shiba Inu Cody has seizures and has been on medication for a few years now because of it. Today I gave him his med a little later than usual. He acted normal for a bit but then he started pacing and acting strange (and jumping on furniture he knows he‚Äôs not allowed to be on). I‚Äôve seen him do this prior to having another seizure. He just wouldn‚Äôt sit down and rest! I remembered I had an opened bag of our hemp treats here (I had joined this company mostly because I felt I personally needed the oil so prior to today I never tried it with my pup), so I took out 1 treat and gave it to him. He sniffed it and ate it with no problem (he‚Äôs sometimes picky with food), I guess that beef flavor got him, he loves beef! Well soon after he gobbled it down I let him outside (he loves chasing lizards lol). I then let a little time go by (about 30 min) and then I peeked out the window to check on him, he was chillin on the grass/dirt lol and getting a suntan! I‚Äôm so glad he‚Äôs calmed down now and resting! I really think these treats did the trick!! I‚Äôm definitely keeping these on hand for him!?

Of course, I had to stop and take a picture with the statue of John Wesley in salute to all of my Candler School of Theology peeps. :) Today is Day 26 - Living Calmly - This piece is discussion maintaining a sense of serenity regardless of what I may see taking place around me. Do I want to be in a state of confusion of have a tranquil inner landscape? Mastery of this calmness only blossoms when I practice being aware of, and responsible for, what I am feeling. Today, in the midst of any kind of unrest ‚Äìarguments, traffic jams, money issues, or anything else‚ÄìI will make the immediate decision to find the calm center within myself. This will put me in harmony with the Divine which is indeed the ultimate calling. (at Historic Reynolds Square)

63897	Calm	63897.jpg	This was the quote on one of my recent meditations, which was focusing on the idea of being present during the pause we‚Äôre taking in our day. As I‚Äôve been getting deeper in my meditation practice, I‚Äôve been noticing the difference in the days when I‚Äôm meditating out of duty and the days when my heart is actually in it. On the days when I‚Äôm doing it because I should, my mind tends to wander; I get easily distracted and fidget in my seat. One those days I‚Äôm not really getting any benefit out of the practice of mediating because my mind is somewhere else. I‚Äôm thinking about my daily life or the things that I need to do tomorrow - on those days it is hard to even take the ten minutes out of my day to pause and reset. I was thinking about this quote in the context of how I play piano. I can read both treble and bass clef which surprises most people since I don‚Äôt have any flauntable musical ability, but I took several years of piano lessons as a kid so if I‚Äôm forced to do so, I can pluck out the melody on a piano. When I do this, though, the melody is really hard to pick out. A song I play would have a rhythm like ‚ÄúTwin- pause- kle, pause, twin-pause-kle, pause. lit-pause-tle star‚Ä¶?I mean, you‚Äôd get it eventually but it wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be easy to identify right off the bat. The way I play piano, the pauses almost feel forced - like someone is making me be there when I don‚Äôt want to be. But when I was a kid, taking those lessons, I could actually play ‚ÄúTwinkle, Twinkle Little Star?from memory and it was easy to tell what song I was playing. Now, the pauses tell the story of how I quit piano lessons, which is probably the only thing from my life that I regret?The pause is as important as the note. It‚Äôs hard to decompress my mind sometimes. It‚Äôs like I was saying recently about how even as recently as college there were times when I didn‚Äôt want to be alone with the silence of my own mind. It‚Äôs hard to shut off and be present in the pauses, even though the pauses are important and are what, ultimately, tell the whole story. KTBSPA! -Lindsey

Some people don‚Äôt believe you can be in that much pain from a period. Thats why it‚Äôs so important we feel open to talking about our menstrual cycles and begin eliminating negative stigmas portraying periods as unclean or humiliating. I have been using Elixicure‚Äôs Hemp Roll-On to help ease my cramps and bloating during my menstrual cycle. For the first time in my life, I am able to leave the bed during my period.

Understanding how our mind works when affected by anxiety, stress or other mental illness helps us in being able to fight those thoughts and give them less power within our mind. Although the exercise might not solve all problems, it can help you regain a clear mind in order to think of other solutions, making it an essential stepping stone in recovery. Take care of yourself, please. And try your best to reach out when things are difficult.

64621	Calm	64621.jpg	I think as humans we‚Äôre always searching. Searching for answers, searching for love, searching for happiness. And while I think we are incredible beings for our curious minds, we sometimes lack the ability to cease and just be, letting whatever may come, come. And because we‚Äôre always swimming, searching, we often miss what otherwise would have come floating in front of us if we just stayed still for a moment. (at Hickam Harbor Marina)

65092	Fear	65092.jpg	Work: L5 Artist: Peter Halley Year 1996 Acrylic, day-glo acrylic, and Roll-a-Tex on canvas So, we have to start somewhere and this is the first piece I saw, so we will begin here and make our way around the museum in due time. Overall, I very much liked this painting, as I‚Äôm a fan of deconstructivism (though today is the first day I learned this was an actual art term. I‚Äôm turning into a regular Pabby Picassy!) as I‚Äôm personally a huge fan of logic puzzles and taking things apart to see how they are designed in their various pieces. Most people call this OCD or being a meth head, but I‚Äôm going to put a nice spin on it. The painting itself both makes me feel joyful and also uncomfortable. It‚Äôs composed of various geometric shapes, some of which resemble prisons. This is where the discomfort comes from as, until very recently, I spent the last 27 years of my life being held in a prison constructed of my own fears. My list of fears was like a menu as the Cheesecake Factory, almost everything was represented. Thankfully, through therapy, meditation, and good ol?fashion pharmaceutical help, I was able to discover the focal point in my brain of those fears, and they all literally almost washed away overnight. The use of colors in this work I found very striking and gave me a wide range of feelings. The red made me feel constricted and anxious. The grey made me feel lost. The blue gave me comfort. While the various yellows either made me cautious or free based on their placement on the canvas. While we are on the subject of the canvas, the piece is actually composed of two separate canvases. The top canvas, is the larger of the two, and I would relate it to the first part of my life. It‚Äôs composed of various geometric shapes that represent prisons and a feeling of containment. The two ‚Äúprison?looking structures are also covered in a rough texture, as compared to the smoothness of the remainder of the piece. This texture represented danger and discomfort to me. The work also contains smaller various geometric shapes that resemble pathways that either lead to the to the geometric prisons or into a path to the unknown. The entire top pathway also has a grey background that made me a sense of confusion or loss. The bottom canvas is the smaller of the two, and represents the beginning of my new life. The aqua blue background feels very freeing to me. It‚Äôs completely separate from the geometric prisons of the above canvas, which I think was intentional by the artist. The yellow and brown geometric shapes also make me think of pathways, but they feel safer. Even those these paths lead to the unknown, the path and end point feel safe and freeing. So, the work as a while made me personally think of a dichotomy between my older confined life, and my new free life. The top represented captivity and false paths. The bottom represented a new life with freedom with no restrictions and and new exciting paths. For my first work, I enjoyed this one, though I did find it hard to fully focus completely on the painting for 30 minutes. Much like it is difficult when you first try out meditation, it is going to take work and exercise on my side to gain that focus. I look forward to this. Here is what the artist says about the work.

65917	Fear	65917.jpg	a message from someone who cares By John Louisse Fernandez. Hey?so?today I just want to talk about something that‚Äôs been prevalent in the past few months and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs something we should just ignore. We can write about art, poetry, love, and all those things next week but today I want to point out the obvious. I want to point out the thing that makes us unconformable and fearful to discuss. What is it you ask? I think that if we look around our global community, it‚Äôs clear that hate, fear, and prejudice are all around us. We can pretend to be social activists, and spread word about every injustice that we hear around the world. But does it matter? Does it change the things that have happened? Does it change us? It seems that the world is filled with ignorance; ignorance which leads hate; hate which leads to fear; and fear which leads to murder. Cold blood murder. The taking away of innocent lives in a matter of a seconds ?just by a push of a button and by a push of a trigger. And just like that ?those who had fears, those who had dreams, those who had hopes, those who had aspirations for a better life are gone. Gone. Gone. The past is gone, there is no history to be made. A blink of a second that transports someone to an eternal darkness. The murder of innocent lives caused by a few egotistic, delusional individuals who care only for themselves and no one else. It‚Äôs hard to accept this reality that our lives, our future, our hopes and dreams can be so easily erased by a few men who desire power for themselves. It‚Äôs heartbreaking. It‚Äôs heartbreaking to see religions hijacked by a few. The world is so chaotic with people trying to force each other‚Äôs beliefs on each other ?killing for gods who preached about love, acceptance, and peace. Religions can save lives and have saved lives many times before, but it is a double-edged sword that also take away innocent lives. I can‚Äôt imagine, nor can I say that I understand, the fear and the vulnerability of those who live in areas affected by war, affected by the quarrel of men. This world can be so overwhelming, changing it seems impossible. Everyone has their own battles, their own struggles, their own demons to slay but we need to keep going. We need to learn from the past and realize the cold fact truth, and that is: selfishness, greed, ignorance, and fear will lead to nothing but a mass grave of a future generation. We need to wake up and understand that we need to open our hearts to each other, to communicate, to learn, and to connect. Bringing awareness to catastrophic events is not a bad thing. But we need to be careful not to be desensitized by these events ?we need to care, to feel genuinely, and acknowledge it fully. It can be overwhelming and I know what it‚Äôs like to feel helpless and useless. My only hope is that the fear, the grief, and the hatred will not deter us from being kind to one another and spreading love in any way possible. Stay soft and keep loving ?we can get through it all. all of my heart, john

66604	Fear	66604.jpg	Why Haunted Houses Creep Us Out From a psychological point of view, the standard features of haunted houses trigger feelings of dread because they push buttons in our brains that evolved long before houses even existed. These alarm buttons warn us of potential danger and motivate us to proceed with caution. Haunted houses give us the creeps not because they pose a clear threat to us, but rather because it is unclear whether or not they represent a threat. This ambivalence leaves you frozen in place, wallowing in unease.	
66610	Fear	66610.jpg	Reconditioning the brain to overcome fear Researchers have discovered a way to remove specific fears from the brain, using a combination of artificial intelligence and brain scanning technology. Their technique, published in the inaugural edition of Nature Human Behaviour, could lead to a new way of treating patients with conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and phobias. Fear related disorders affect around one in 14 people and place considerable pressure on mental health services. Currently, a common approach is for patients to undergo some form of aversion therapy, in which they confront their fear by being exposed to it in the hope they will learn that the thing they fear isn‚Äôt harmful after all. However, this therapy is inherently unpleasant, and many choose not to pursue it. Now a team of neuroscientists from the University of Cambridge, Japan and the USA, has found a way of unconsciously removing a fear memory from the brain. The team developed a method to read and identify a fear memory using a new technique called ‚ÄòDecoded Neurofeedback? The technique used brain scanning to monitor activity in the brain, and identify complex patterns of activity that resembled a specific fear memory. In the experiment, a fear memory was created in 17 healthy volunteers by administering a brief electric shock when they saw a certain computer image. When the pattern was detected, the researchers over-wrote the fear memory by giving their experimental subjects a reward. Dr. Ben Seymour, of the University of Cambridge‚Äôs Engineering Department, was one of the authors on the study. He explained the process: ‚ÄúThe way information is represented in the brain is very complicated, but the use of artificial intelligence (AI) image recognition methods now allow us to identify aspects of the content of that information. When we induced a mild fear memory in the brain, we were able to develop a fast and accurate method of reading it by using AI algorithms. The challenge then was to find a way to reduce or remove the fear memory, without ever consciously evoking it. "We realised that even when the volunteers were simply resting, we could see brief moments when the pattern of fluctuating brain activity had partial features of the specific fear memory, even though the volunteers weren‚Äôt consciously aware of it. Because we could decode these brain patterns quickly, we decided to give subjects a reward - a small amount of money - every time we picked up these features of the memory.? The team repeated the procedure over three days. Volunteers were told that the monetary reward they earned depended on their brain activity, but they didn‚Äôt know how. By continuously connecting subtle patterns of brain activity linked to the electric shock with a small reward, the scientists hoped to gradually and unconsciously override the fear memory. (Image caption: Scan of brain showing information associated with a fear memory. Credit: Ai Koizumi) Dr Ai Koizumi, of the Advanced Telecommunicatons Research Institute International, Kyoto and Centre of Information and Neural Networks, Osaka, led the research: ‚ÄúIn effect, the features of the memory that were previously tuned to predict the painful shock, were now being re-programmed to predict something positive instead.? The team then tested what happened when they showed the volunteers the pictures previously associated with the shocks. ‚ÄúRemarkably, we could no longer see the typical fear skin-sweating response. Nor could we identify enhanced activity in the amygdala - the brain‚Äôs fear centre,?she continued. ‚ÄúThis meant that we‚Äôd been able to reduce the fear memory without the volunteers ever consciously experiencing the fear memory in the process.? Although the sample size in this initial study was relatively small, the team hopes the technique can be developed into a clinical treatment for patients with PTSD or phobias. ‚ÄúTo apply this to patients, we need to build a library of the brain information codes for the various things that people might have a pathological fear of, say, spiders?adds Dr Seymour. "Then, in principle, patients could have regular sessions of Decoded Neurofeedback to gradually remove the fear response these memories trigger.? Such a treatment could have major benefits over traditional drug based approaches. Patients could also avoid the stress associated with exposure therapies, and any side-effects resulting from those drugs.

66623	Fear	66623.jpg	At any given moment, either we are in love, or we are in fear. Technically, every human emotion can be boiled down to fitting into one, or the other of these two categories. The question is why would anyone want to remain in fear? It is a choice we make. We may not realize we are making that choice, but ultimately we do. Self observation is then a very good tool to use in our battle against remaining in fear. It becomes a matter of watching ourselves and asking, ‚ÄúAm I in fear or love at this moment? Am I coming at this conflict from the perspective of fear or love? Am I dealing with this problem from the perspective of fear or love??It is important to understand that fear can desguise itself, and hide within us in forms we don‚Äôt realize. We can fool ourselves into thinking that our actions are coming from love when it is actually fear that is behind them. It is therefore important to be honest with ourselves, and truly examine our decisions, but in the end it comes down to the question of whether we are acting out of fear or love at any given moment. We then make a commitment to one or the other. Simply said, when we are in love things go right. When we are in fear, things go wrong. When we are in love we accept what we cannot change. When we are in fear, we push ourselves into the frustration of trying to change what we refuse to accept. When we return to love, we always return to comfort, acceptance, and ultimately joy. It is as simple as that. It may seem difficult to accomplish, but it is, in truth, simple. Work on staying in love. There is nothing else you need to do.

When you texted me saying ‚Äúnevermind,?I just thought you no longer needed to talk, that you safely made it home, that you were quietly going back to sleep. 10 am - I text asking what was going on. ? you reply saying you ran off the road.

Reality: You climbed for 10 minutes on hands & knees out the ‚Äúditch?in the freezing rain. You hydroplaned off the interstate & spun out of control, damn near into a lake (though you say the lake was on the other side). Thank God you were okay! A million thoughts ran through my head. Immediately, I wanted to cry, but I had to stay strong for you. I had to make sure you were okay. You were. Yesterday, my biggest fear came true: something happening to you on the road. Thank God: He kept you safe. He wrapped you in His hands & took complete control. Material things were destroyed, but my baby, my heart, my other half, was safe.

The first thing I should‚Äôve done was hugged you. I should‚Äôve wrapped you in my arms & held on tight. I froze. Vulnerability and emotions + me = don‚Äôt mix. I should‚Äôve held you. I should‚Äôve told you it was going to be okay. At that moment, you needed me. Why couldn‚Äôt I come through? I want to hug you right now. I want to see you. I want a redo. I want to cry. You‚Äôre my other half, my best friend. I can‚Äôt lose you. I love you so much. I couldn‚Äôt protect you. I feel helpless. I feel lost.

66737	Fear	66737.jpg	I died. But, in a moment, I seemed to reconnect to every nerve, and became aware of every sensation - moreso than I ever was in life. I perceived myself trapped within an immovable object, and the intensity of the struggle amplified: subtle, then acute, then racking. I cannot describe it completely - but imagine holding your breath, beyond urge, beyond pain, beyond desperation - head throbbing and eyes bulging - a dream of suffocation without end. My skin blistered and split in the sunlight; biting insects descended rapidly. I felt eggs hatch, larvae crawl, gases build and burst within me, individual cells rupturing, interstitial fluids souring and blackening. Somehow my capacity to experience and store these sensations grew - even as I was keenly aware of my cerebrum being scattered and devoured, my perception expanded, into the gizzards of birds and the depths of fire ant dens. I was aware of every fingernail and strand of hair that pulled away in the wind - and my sensation clung to them as they settled in the ocean and dissolved in the maws of a trillion diatoms. I don‚Äôt understand it. The more bits of me there were, the larger my capacity for the perception of pain. As I decayed into pieces smaller than living nerves could possibly distinguish, the character of the discomfort changed - from burning and aching and breaking I might relate to you in human terms - to something worse that I cannot fully articulate: a terrible, maddening stretching of every part of myself from every other part. Humans often numb to chronic pains in life, do they not? Yet every year, every month, every second that passed - I swear it only intensified over time. In my previous life, I ruminated on Heaven and Hell, and the likelihood of my experiencing one, the other, or something in between. As terrible as I imagined the torpor of Heaven or the torments of Hell to be, this was entirely different from either. In Hell, at least, there would surely be a tormentor, some memory of my deeds, some sense of justice, even if my soul rejected its logic. I can imagine some comfort in Hell, for a mind such as mine. I do not think this is a punishment. I do not think it is caused. I deeply suspect it is simply our condition, our nature to go on this way, do you see? In all that time, I was certainly, absolutely, totally alone, and before long all memory of life had shriveled to a cinder, lost beneath my interminable anguish. Alive again, I suspect I cannot quite recall the worst of it - as if my living brain is too small for the experience.I was dead for eighteen years, and my misery eludes description. Dare we try to fathom the collective agony of legions of ancient dead? Believe this: I will not return to that execrable existence. Not a hundred years from now, not ever. Anything is better, so long as it is forever.

66835	Fear	66835.jpg	There‚Äôs a difference between caution and fear. Caution evaluates the situation, looking at consequences versus benefits and then makes a decision based on the evaluation. Fear either avoids a decision or depends on someone else to come to the rescue. Fear may be so repressed within us that we don‚Äôt recognize it. It may manifest in the form of dependency, hoping that others will take care of us, and do what we need to do for ourselves. Avoidance is a form of fear and may take many forms, including the avoidance of doing what we need to do to take care of ourselves on a day-to-day basis. Courage is the choice we make when we stop listening to fear. Courage is not without caution. It understands possible consequences but knows, with faith, that we can face those possible consequences. Courage is Faith balanced with wisdom. When we are afraid to face life, when we do not have faith in ourselves, life often bulldozes over us, leaving us with even more fear. Courage is when we know we can handle what needs to be handled while we place our faith in a higher power to show us how. Courage is Faith put to action. Courage is not only trust in a higher power, but trust in ourselves. While fear waits for someone else to take care of it, or hopes that it will go away, courage steps up and does what needs to be done.

66845	Fear	66845.jpg	If you consider it carefully, there‚Äôs nothing really scary in life. Absolutely nothing. Just about everything, pondered on a universal scale, or simply compared to the wider temporal aspect of life in general, comes to a quiet property of relativeness which doesn‚Äôt reduce its importance, but diminish its emotional effect. Yet, at the same time, considering the other side of the coin, almost anything could have a huge impact, long lasting consequences, and a deep significance. I‚Äôve been through a lot in life, to quite safely say that I‚Äôm touched by everything, and nothing, at the same time!

67131	Fear	67131.jpg	New article has been published on What the Bible says about fear, anxiety, and courage - how to shirk the crippling embrace of fear Fear is ironic. We revel in the paralyzing fear we feel when riding a roller coaster but hate the tingle of fear we feel when standing near the edge of a cliff. We enjoy the terror we feel while watching a horror movie but dread the fear of entering a dark house. The difference between fear we enjoy and fear we loathe is the level of control we have over the outcome. Regardless, all fears can be overcome.

67177	Fear	67177.jpg	Some say it is the love of money which is the root of all evil, but the Bible verse looked at in terms of eros or lust means that the lust for money is the root of evil, in other words, greed. There is nothing wrong with having huge amounts of wealth with giant bank accounts as long as we do not make that our god. It is not the amount of money in someone‚Äôs bank account that defiles them, but the amont of greed in their heart. There are people who have practically nothing in the way of wealth who are just as greedy. It is when our focus is on selfishness that we do wrong in the world. Why would anyone ever think to steal if not out of selfishness or some fear of lack? Boiled down, selfishness is essentially fear of lack. It is the opposite of a prosperity consciousness in which we trust that our needs will be met and we will be able to have the ideas and awareness we need to be comfortable in life. A fear of lack sets us up to focus so much on what we are going to get that we may fail to be giving. It sets us up to be constantly terrified that we won‚Äôt have enough, and when we have that terror, we are far more likely to be tempted into taking advantage of others in order to get what we want. Love, genuine love, not eros or lust, is in no way selfish. It gives, and pours out without expectation of return. If this were to be the focus of everyone, there would be no lack in the world, for no one would be left out or left without. So, it matters not what we have in our bank accouts, but matters all what wealth we have in our hearts, and whether love is our focus in the world instead of selfishness. We alone, each one individually, are the only ones capable of changing what is in our hearts. No one can do that for us, and God himself would never force us to change, for to do so would be selfish and there can be no selfishness in divine love.

Until you make that choice to shine the light of your consciousness upon them. And as you take time to perceive them fully, you will begin to expose the illusions that made them scary. Then just like in Scooby Doo, when the fears are unmasked, they become a regular old thing.

67867	Fear	67867.jpg	New Post has been published on How to Use Fear to Destroy Laziness You‚Äôre reading How to Use Fear to Destroy Laziness, originally posted on Pick the Brain | Motivation and Self Improvement. If you‚Äôre enjoying this, please visit our site for more inspirational articles. It‚Äôs the start of the New Year, and we want to reach our full potential. Yet, its so easy to be lazy. We live in an age with the highest amount of distractions ?with so many options for entertainment e.g. Seasons of Game of Thrones. We have so much information flowing into our minds on a daily basis through advertising, work, and what we hear through our social circle. With all that going on, it‚Äôs easy to lose touch with what we should be doing with our time. Unless we really know what‚Äôs important to us, we can fall into excessive patterns of: watching T.V, surfing the web, socializing to an extreme ?all to fill in the hole of emptiness we feel when we don‚Äôt keep ourselves distracted. That feeling of discomfort when you go to bed, that extra sleep in the morning ?it‚Äôs often all partly related to not doing the things you know you should be doing. Whether that‚Äôs: studying that subject you used to be excited about, writing that book, consistently working out, building a business, creating videos, learning from other people, playing your favorite sport, teaching something you‚Äôre passionate about, reading books, gaining new experiences, travelling, or else. Without a strategy on how you‚Äôre going to spend your time, you can live many years without reaching your full potential ?not doing the things you truly want to do. Unless you bring what you want to the forefront of your mind, and then do those things, you will fail in achieving a consistent baseline of positive emotions. Yet, you might not even realize it until a year or two has passed by. For many of us, so little time is invested in improving ourselves, expressing ourselves, and creating. Too much time is spent absorbing content, replaying our past, worrying about the future, all while we lament our lifestyles, and take little action to change our realities. Let‚Äôs describe the story of someone called ‚ÄòJimmy? The way to become the best version of you, is to firstly understand how to be the worst version of yourself. The Story of ‚ÄòJimmy? If you looked at his life beginning from the 1st January to the 31st December, you would see little variety in Jimmy‚Äôs days. He never travels. Never skips town. He hangs around with the same people, who are also in the same life situation as him. Stuck. Unwilling to push himself out of his comfort zone, he subconsciously reasons that it‚Äôs okay since others are the same. He sleeps and wakes up at different times everyday. The result is a messed up sleeping cycle that acts as the foundation for his life. To add to that, he works in a dead-end job that sucks most of his precious energy. The cycle repeats itself weekly. He never reads any books, he simply has no interest in expanding his knowledge or delving into stories. He is completely self-absorbed in the mental masturbation of his mind. He worries, frets and is always pondering. But perhaps he shares a joke or two with one or two friends every now and then. Yet he rarely pauses to simply breathe. There‚Äôs a lack of inspiration for betterment in his life and the cause of this is deeply rooted in taking life for granted. He fails to see the brilliance and wonder of the world. He never fully seizes the day. His life is marred by the attainment for short term pleasure. He saves very little of his money and instead splurges it on fast food, ice cream, desserts, cigarettes, and alcohol. He has no long term direction, it‚Äôs simply not in his paradigm of thought. He fails to see how his present is influencing his future. He doesn‚Äôt really know what he wants from life. His past is a daze and he never tries to learn or embody any lessons from his experiences. He spends lavishly on the things that don‚Äôt matter, little on the things that do. His home is cluttered, and messy ?just like his mind. He doesn‚Äôt exercise, and his body is tight and tense. As a result, all his family, friends, and the world don‚Äôt benefit from the extraordinary person he could become. In short, he is selfish and he doesn‚Äôt even realize it. Maybe you partly relate with the story of ‚ÄòJimmy? I know I do and I only tell this story because we‚Äôre often motivated by the extreme bell-end curve of being positive. We rarely think about the ramifications of not living meaningfully. This may be an extreme example, but it‚Äôs a useful one. Fear, just like any emotion, isn‚Äôt inherently bad or good. It can be used to our advantage, and by remembering the sentiment behind this story, we can use it to fuel us to lead better lives on the occasions where we‚Äôre not being perhaps inspired by love. Your Challenge The biggest challenge we face is having the courage to make changes. Let‚Äôs learn we find meaningful, and which days we‚Äôll dedicate to those activities. Let‚Äôs develop daily habits that help us feel terrific each day. Let‚Äôs experiment with different things we find fascinating. An inability to identify the unique factors that lead to a meaningful and fulfilling life, is responsible for creating unhappy men and women all around the world. But by having an allegiance to making positive changes and using your time wisely, you will be well on your way to lead a meaningful, fulfilling life ?no matter what difficulties life throws at you. If you‚Äôre interested in mastering your habits in the New Year, read my free guide. Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll learn: First, You‚Äôll find out how to split up your day into four chunks, so you‚Äôll worry less about external influences. Second, You‚Äôll discover how to consistently celebrate your small wins, so that you feel more creative and enthusiastic each day. Third, I‚Äôll show you the small productivity hacks that will take your output to the next level. Samy Felice is a writer who is passionate about unique ideas related to living a meaningful life.

67991	Fear	67991.jpg	The human brain has no small amount of trouble keeping its shit together when it encounters something that looks like a real face but isn‚Äôt. At first glance, we all have an automatic visceral reaction to anything that remotely resembles a Homo sapiens mug, which partially explains why the more neurotic among us see stuff like the Virgin Mary in a slice of toast or Benedict Cumberbatch staring at us in the bark of an old maple tree. It‚Äôs important from an evolutionary perspective that we make connections like that. Obviously, the earlier you notice that competing caveman sneaking up on you with a stabbin?stick in hand, the better. It‚Äôs probably safe to say that those who didn‚Äôt have this trait died off rather quickly. Pareidolia is the name for this reaction, and dolls play right into the instinctual jitters that ensue ?but only if they‚Äôre fashioned with more skill than the average Amish pinecone-on-a-twig children‚Äôs toy. Prior to the advent of realistic-looking dolls, pediophobia (the fear of dolls) wasn‚Äôt really a thing, because the average children‚Äôs toy was somewhere in between a dried apple doll and a bowel movement. But as dolls became more realistic ?and most notably, as robotic simulacrums have become way too lifelike for their own good ?the ‚ÄúUncanny Valley?effect has been tweaking that primitive place inside our heads that tells us we should either immediately start running or scan the vicinity for a melting apparatus. 7 Of Your Dumb Fears (Science Says Are Justified)

68167	Fear	68167.jpg	The first comment was made by Joan Gerry on a Daily Beast story about the capture of a suspect believed to be involved in the New York and New Jersey bombings. The second photo is what she shared on her public page nine minutes before calling for the U.S. government to commit a war crime and murder this man‚Äôs family, accompanied by cute lil?knife and angry face emojis. I‚Äôm sharing this because I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôm tired of seeing these comments day after day, clicking on the person‚Äôs profile, only to see adorable dog pictures, recipes for upside down pineapple cake, and cutesy minion memes. This comment is monstrous. And yet, she looks like any number of the women I attended Mass with, and who are my mother‚Äôs friends. I‚Äôm tired of worrying for the safety of my Muslim friends, my friends who are people of color, or who have ‚ÄúArab?sounding names (as one commenter put it), because of statements like this. The absolute disconnect between what she, and so many others, believe and say is astonishing. And they say it publicly. Advocates against online harassment will sometimes push using a Facebook based commenting system to cut anonymity but it doesn‚Äôt solve the problem. In one sentence, she completely dehumanized and othered the suspect‚Äôs family, calling for their violent murder. What makes it different than a terrorist of any faith, ethnicity, race, etc. imploring murder? To be absolutely clear, I DO NOT want people to turn around and harass this woman. Do not sink to their level. She is one of many, many people who have no trouble spewing this vitriol online and then inviting you in for a piece of pie. Those people are more frightening than the man arrested today.

68349	Fear	68349.jpg	Make a deal with yourself to try something new. Try these basic therapy exercises when you‚Äôre alone. THE WALL The good thing about walls is that the other side can‚Äôt touch you. Building walls isn‚Äôt always the best way to treat depression, but a tricky road with wayward trails could use some barricades. Picture a wall in front of you. I prefer a colorless white. Behind this wall lives your fears. Fear of abandonment Fear of the dark Fear of love All the great fears. For now, they live behind this wall‚Ä¶They cannot touch you because the wall is strong. You can keep walking and know exactly where this wall is, knowing you can return to it at any time. Of course, why would you? ?you‚Äôre on the path to greatness. THE BLANK CANVAS You‚Äôre starting over today. Whoever you were yesterday is gone. Picture yourself implanted in this world with no memory or past. Should a memory arise, imagine yourself painting over it with a colorless white. Keep painting until you find yourself? ‚Ä¶completely blank. ASK THE QUESTION What would you do if you woke up without fear or memories? For me, I would run. I would just get up and go, and I would not rest until I went as far as I could. Then I would go home, shower, make a sensible meal, and read any of the unread books on my shelf. I would read it until it was done. I would draw out my thoughts in a sketchbook the next day and find myself between the lines. This exercise is meant to make you live in the present. You should feel a sense of peace as old fears are blocked (for now), and you‚Äôve completely lost your memory. Your job? Nonexistent. Your car payment? Nonexistent. At least for today‚Ä¶because you‚Äôre on the path to greatness. Today, I got the better of my blunders. <!-- more --> Furthermore? This is the first mental exercise of many that will test your ability to creatively outsmart your depression. Some people have the luxury of waking up every day without worries. These fears and memories combine with depression to make you feel trapped. For those who often get trapped inside because they see every embarrassment or fear looming around the corner, the wall is there to prevent you from going down the rabbit-hole. While losing your memory may seem traumatic or dramatic, it‚Äôs completely legal to feign like everything is alright and nothing bothers you. How else would you do this besides wiping your memory? It can be difficult the first time to picture the wall barricading you from fears. Walls can be as strong as you allow them to be, so ensure that you fortify your wall and protect yourself until you‚Äôre ready to fight. FAQs: Q: Why build a wall ‚Äòfor now? Walls should only be used temporarily in emergency situations. If you find yourself at the end of your rope, staring into the abyss every morning, then building a wall could save your life. Eventually, you‚Äôll have to find a way to let those walls down when you need to. Be gentle with yourself. Q: Why ‚Äòcolorless white? It is the most simple thing to picture. Can‚Äôt you sit and see a white wall? What would you draw on it if you could? I‚Äôd paint a window to another world.

68423	Fear	68423.jpg	Why Men Shouldn‚Äôt Fear Strong, Successful And Intelligent Women. There are numerous articles claiming that men are afraid of strong, intelligent women. This is partly true, as not all men are fearful of this type of woman. It seems, however, to be a majority. The value of such articles is to create awareness. Once awareness has been raised, it is possible to move towards the solution through understanding. The problem we face today, is an energy that has been flowing through society for centuries, establishing a set of false beliefs, separation, the supremacy of men over women and all living creatures promoted by the archaic values of a patriarchal society, which is tumbling on its foundations. These values and beliefs also contributed to men to adopt a series of attitudes and behaviors that helped to eclipse the beautiful expression of the divine masculine, as well as suffocating the divine feminine. Thus far, humanity has been living in shadows. How intelligent is that! Fearing strong and intelligent women is nothing but a trapped energy in men. It is also an unconscious response. In order to change the perception when interacting with this type of woman, we must challenge the beliefs we hold on masculinity. From an early age, men are educated to be more of everything, and more than everyone. The competition is not only with women, it is also with other men. Setting such high standards serves to create anxiety when meeting our own limits, as well as separation and loneliness. It is a man against the world. The future of humanity is cooperation with both men and women, and a renewed education system that teaches children to be human beings and live in peace and equality. When a woman is strong and intelligent, she is likely to be confident about her attributes and capabilities. It is no wonder that in the competitive society we live in, women also feel the need to overpower others, including men, resulting in a type of behavior that in appearance might feel threatening. It is not. Instead is the assertiveness of the own self. Intelligence is sexy. Learn to dance to its rhythm. An intelligent woman will know when to listen and when to talk. This is an advantage, as in the relationships between men and women, women are prone to interrupt, now allowing the interaction to flow. It‚Äôs not a matter of intelligence, but the urge to be heard. If she‚Äôs intelligent, she will allow the necessary spaces and tempos for a man to expand his conversation, feelings and desires. These are signs of interest in open and deep conversations and interactions. The relationship could vary in nature, and whether this is romantic, friendship or professional, an intelligent woman would act accordingly. She will also find the strengths and natural abilities in a man, so as to help him to grow and improve. A woman can help a man to build an empire. The more intelligent she is, the more persistent she will be. Women naturally seek cooperation. If she‚Äôs gifted with a higher intelligence, she will use it to create. Intelligence is like water for growth. Intelligence is a positive trait, not a weapon. Anyone using intelligence to destroy anyone, whether this is a man or a woman, might not be as intelligent as they thought or perhaps do not understand the nature, value or use of intelligence. More intelligence in most cases means more knowledge, and more resources to face and resolve situations. If she‚Äôs strong, she will share that knowledge and encourage a man to use it for his own benefit. Knowledge only has power when it‚Äôs shared. Conversations with her are also likely to be varied and colorful, perhaps exploring the roots of the issue discussed, so as to reach a deeper understanding, and a colorful expression. An intelligent woman will find the way to convey a message, and explain a subject matter without the need to feel less intelligent or less educated. It‚Äôs only the weak who prey on the weak. The fact that she‚Äôs intelligent does not make her a threat. She is a human being. She has a heart and a soul, like everyone else. It makes her sensitive to certain triggers and situations, as it happens with every individual. What she wants more than anything is love. Intelligence does not make her an exception. Intelligence makes a woman more perceptive. This only would represent a problem when a man‚Äôs intentions are not good. If a man is hiding secrets or leading a life that forces him to hide information from others, intelligence does not make any difference. Women always know. Intelligence might be an intrinsic part of her, but that‚Äôs not all there is to her. She has other parts, and it is for a man to find out and unveil the mystery of her soul. If she‚Äôs successful, she will use her resources to encourage, help and support a man to reach success. In this sense, women are more generous and do not fear competition as much as we men do. There could be, of course, exceptional cases in a professional environment in which a woman has to compete with men and other women. Such is society these days, but this fact cannot and shouldn‚Äôt be used against her. We use what we have, to get what we want and need. Women make sacrifices, men do not know of. In a relationship, all these qualities can contribute to improve it, as communication with an intelligent woman tends to flow towards openness. Like everyone else, she will have her most beautiful place within, her sensitivities and anxieties, but overall, she will use her abilities to make it grow. Women have not been educated to be above men, therefore, she will be willing to help a man to expand and grow in every aspect that is required. Intelligence is a tool of service, to the self first, then to others. At some point the nurturing part will open and you‚Äôll feel embraced. It is important for a man to consider that meeting or interacting with an intelligent woman is not a contest. Challenging old beliefs and shifting our perception about what we have been told and taught to be can only open to possibilities of integration, love, equality and unity. The role of men and the divine masculine is to support the balance of energies, so as to allow the divine feminine to emerge towards the creation of the new earth. Some women would be more intelligent, some would be less. On this they‚Äôre not different than men. Intelligence is overrated. Perhaps the essential part to realize is that intelligence, like every other aspect of the human condition is something that we have to transcend. We‚Äôre all too serious about life. We‚Äôre nothing but children playing adulthood and growing deeper frowns and frustrations because we don‚Äôt understand it and don‚Äôt know how to play the game. An intelligent woman would know how to do that. She also has her flaws, and she knows about it. Maybe fear presents itself in these situations because a man feels that he won‚Äôt be able to overpower such woman, as tradition dictates. We men seriously have to question the values and beliefs that have been imposed on us, and allow the natural abilities in others to flow, so as to create a new world. We all play a different part, and only together we will get to a stage in which we‚Äôre all thrive in peace and love. An interaction with a strong and intelligent woman is an excellent opportunity for a man to explore his vulnerabilities, feelings and emotions. This is something that we have been trained to avoid and which is essential for a man to work on, if he ever wants to find inner peace. We don‚Äôt always have to be strong. Once feelings are allowed to flow, a woman is more receptive. At this point, intelligence will play its part in putting together all the necessary tools for understanding, nurturing and healing. Intelligence is not an attribute exclusive to men. And if there‚Äôs anything men fear, this is women altogether. Intelligence is only a trait, but one that allows a man to test his own limitations, to engage in a process of learning and to grow personally. The first day at school we didn‚Äôt know what we know now. This is the same. Intelligent or not, the way to reach a woman is through her heart and her soul. And maybe, only maybe, perhaps we‚Äôre afraid of showing ours. Think about that. It‚Äôs interesting that most women fear men due to rape, violence or death, and that we allow ourselves to be intimidated by an IQ number. It really is time that we men begin to reconsider what we think we know. Let‚Äôs give ourselves a break. We don‚Äôt have to know everything.

I wish I could make myself smaller but I‚Äôm already sitting on the hard dusty ground. He‚Äôs waiting for me to do something. I don‚Äôt remember what. His clothes are rough and faded from years of use. His hands are idle at his sides. Dirty fingernails and hairy knuckles stare at me menacingly. At a moments notice they could be gripping my neck. Under my hands I feel the hard gravel and the dry rock dusk. He is too close to me for me to attempt running. If I did he would easily grab ahold of me and jerk me right back. His face is dark under the shade of his hat but I can still see the indication of sweat on his temples running down into his beard and I can smell the whiskey on his breath mixed with sweet tobacco and the heated leather of his vest. Under my light top my heart beats like a hummingbird‚Äôs wings, pumping adrenaline through my molten veins. My mind becomes milk as I can‚Äôt think anymore.

68844	Fear	68844.jpg	Illustration- Anthophobia Boise State University, Drawing I, Spring?5 This was for a drawing assignment in which we needed to interpret some kind of phobia. With that being said I went with anthophobia, the fear of flowers because it seemed unusual, but also potentially something beautiful. When I think of flowers I think of them as having feminine qualities, so naturally I went with a female figure to embody this idea. However, rather than have her afraid I went with making her look serious, as if she is what causes the fear, not the fear itself. I began with a sketch that I then edited and colored in Photoshop. Once I felt the image was complete I then had it printed on magazine paper to give it a polished look; almost as if it was really meant to be in a publication.	
68845	Fear	68845.jpg	Overcoming Fear I once met a woman who had a tattoo strewn across her eyelids, reading ‚ÄúNo Fear.?It became apparent to me that this woman has at least some amount of fear, or there would be no reason for her to relay such a bold statement in such a visible (and might I add, uncomfortable) place. Perhaps she had conquered a bout of fear at one point in her life, therefore rendering her free of all fear. Fear is one of the hardest things to overcome. Fear paralyzes people. Talented people with bright futures often remain stagnant in their lives because the fear of failure. At Purity, we believe that fear can be overcome. Like many things in life, this takes focus, perseverance and hard work. Overcoming your fears is a continual process. Fear is not left in the dust overnight, nor is it gone with the wind, once you have conquered it. (Sorry, Ms. Tattoo!) Fear can creep back in your life when circumstances change. First, be aware of your fear. You can‚Äôt conquer a fear if you do not know that it exists. Discover what specifically makes this a fear of yours. Identify what makes you feel this way. Perhaps you have a fear that you will not be able to make friends in a new place, and so you forego moving ?even though it could be a positive change. You have now realized that a fear exists and you have identified that you are afraid of not having many social connections. Dig a little deeper! What bothers you about not having connections? Perhaps you have an overwhelming fear of being lonely. Now that you have identified, what follows is the actions you will take. Taking action is the best way to combat what is happening internally ?rather than becoming numb to fear and remaining stagnant! Using the above example, instead of becoming anxious that you will be lonely, try researching a church or recreation group in that new area. Find a local coffee shop and commit to frequenting it. To start, you may just be acquaintances with the Baristas on staff. Before you know it, you will feel more comfortable around these familiar faces, and a friendship could be established. Take steps that will allow you to feel more comfortable. Again, by joining a group you may still experience fearful or lonely feelings. This is a process. In this case, building relationships with others does take time, and it cannot be expected to happen overnight. By reaching out and taking action, you are well on your way to developing connections. In addition to these steps, get into a few habits. Journal, and share your concerns with a close friend. Gain other perspective than just your own. Lastly, to overcome fear of any kind, you have to believe in yourself. If you believe in yourself, there is very little you cannot do. From personal experience, I have had several medical issues that prevented me from running, like shin splints. It sounds very silly, but for the longest time, I would not run on the treadmill at the gym because I feared that I would look stupid. The reality was that I was worried that I would have to stop running continually, to ease the pain and pressure on my joints. I did not want others to think that I was completely out of shape. One day, I decided that I was going to run, and simply not care about the opinions of any onlookers. Before I knew it, I was running on the treadmill daily. Although simple, this was such a freeing moment. What I had been avoiding for years, was now commonplace. I believed that I was capable of anything. By Tate Calvo

68918	Fear	68918.jpg	OTP is so hard in this one I made a short drabble out of nowhere ~ (Forgive me I have terrible typing skills) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Anger paced back and forth in the headquarters, he stayed up the evening thinking and building up courage to say those words. Those words to make a someone‚Äôs heart go fast. Those words to make the person melt. Those words that you‚Äôve been meaning to hear. Sadness, Disgust and Joy have turned in for the night while Fear head down to the control panel. The red emotion waited and kept fidgeting, he couldn‚Äôt wait any longer, he was nervous. Joy bid him goodnight minutes ago before heading out. Fear on the other hand brought his trusty brown clip board and a cup of coffee. The 2 emotions, Fear and Anger were in charge of dream duty, of course, someone‚Äôs gotta watch Fear. The last time he woke Riley up was because of clown‚Äôs jumping all around. ‚ÄúSoooooo, I got a bunch of lists that we‚Äôll be expecting tomorrow. I‚Äôve been planning and..?the tall emotion chuckled ‚Äú‚Ä¶usually I never plan ahead but this is good in case Riley will end up with something terrible and I don‚Äôt want that to happen?He sipped his coffee and smacked his lips, Anger watched those lips smack, it was soft‚Ä¶he imagined and lingered to kiss those thin lips, along with the taste of the coffee he drank, the short emotion blushed and folded his arms then looked away ‚ÄúGood to know?His reply was bitter as the usual. Riley was finally fast asleep, only was left is Fear and Anger, sitting by the control panel and watching dreams go by. Fear was rather amused in predicting scenarios, it‚Äôs like he almost memorized them. What was unexpected was Riley‚Äôs dream is now about her and a boy, having a moment. Not those extreme intimate moments, more like holding hands, normal puppy love moments for teenagers. Anger couldn‚Äôt help but to imagine that it was him and Fear, he still couldn‚Äôt tell yet, it felt too early I guess. ‚ÄúWoah‚Ä¶this is something new for Riley, don‚Äôt you think, Anger? Fear turned to look at Anger ‚ÄúAnger??He said once more until Anger looked up at Fear. ‚ÄúHuh‚Ä¶what?!?His head steamed a bit and was embarrassed to be seen by Fear but kept his cool but furrowing his brows, even tho he has no brows. ‚ÄúAre you ok? It‚Äôs like you‚Äôve seen a ghost, heh?Fear gave a faded smile at Anger, the red brick‚Äôs heart beat fast to see those lips curve into a smile. ‚ÄúY-yeah, I‚Äôm fine just‚Ä¶?Anger was about to blow but then he gripped on both sides of Fear‚Äôs arms tightly, causing the purple emotion to tense up after yelping and turned afraid. ‚ÄúWill‚Ä¶will..will you..? ‚ÄúA-anger‚Ä¶you‚Äôre scaring me right now, please let go of me?The fear in his eyes was shown, his pupils were about to water and Anger saw his reaction, he lets go immediately and apologized deeply. Fear slumped down and looked at Anger with pity as the red emotion looked to face the other way. The night was just starting.

69165	Fear	69165.jpg	Matthew 6:25b-34 ~ ‚Äú‚Ä¶do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing? Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? Which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature? So why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin; and yet I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. Now if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? Therefore do not worry, saying, ‚ÄôWhat shall we eat??or ‚ÄòWhat shall we wear??For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.? ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî? There is more to life than fame. There is more to life than power. There is more to life than money. There is more to life than grades. There is more to life than insecurities. There is more to life than a job. There is more to life than uncertainties. There is more to life than _________. (You fill in the blank.) God does not intend for His people to worry. Trust the LORD.

69527	Fear	69527.jpg	I made this mask to represent the face of fear. I‚Äôm a much stronger and more independent person than I was even a year ago, but I still give in to fear way too often. Sometimes it‚Äôs small stuff, and sometimes large. Most distressing of all is the fact that I sometimes give in to fears from both sides of a single coin. Like, I have fear of failure, but also fear of success. I have fear of being seen, and also fear of not being seen. Fear of dying‚Ä¶and sometimes fear of living. And those extra hands keep the mask held on tightly at all times. It never goes away. So the best thing that I can do for myself is to acknowledge that it‚Äôs there, it‚Äôs a part of me, and just start dealing with it. Lean into all of those fears, and get used to feeling them, without collapsing under the weight of them. None of the other alternatives out there are really all that workable for me, so this is the stance I get to take. What about you? What are you afraid of? Or what other kinds of masks do you hide behind? (at Los Angeles, California)

69572	Fear	69572.jpg	The world is full of turmoil ?wars, terrorism, and conflicts. In our lives, we also experience problems and difficulties that can be overwhelming. Maybe it‚Äôs a financial problem, a health scare, or a bad relationship. Medical experts, self-help authors, and motivational speakers all offer solutions to something that is often elusive: peace of mind. But there‚Äôs a certain peace that only Jesus can give, a peace that surpasses all understanding. It‚Äôs the kind of peace that allows us to be at rest even in the midst of life‚Äôs storms. Jesus said ?Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.? Do you feel troubled or afraid right now? Trust Jesus to fix your problem for you. Photo Credit: 55Laney69

70224	Fear	70224.jpg	Today‚Äôs HALLOWEEN HORROR BOOK is; ‚ÄúThe Ghastly One: The Sex-Gore Netherworld of Filmmaker Andy Milligan? by Jimmy McDonough. Detailing the strange life, career, and Uber-Ultra-No-Budget films of ‚ÄòGutter Auteur?Andy Milligan, this book accurately describes the true horror of working in the low-budget film industry. From Library Journal; The Marquis de Sade had nothing on filmmaker Andy Milligan, who between 1965 to 1988 cranked out a prodigious number of plays and 29 sex-and-exploitation films, many of which are now lost, with such sleazoid titles as The Filthy Five, Gutter Trash, Fleshpot on 42nd St., and Torture Dungeon. It would be (sl)easy to dismiss Milligan, who died of AIDS in 1991, as a grindhouse auteur, but that, as journalist and biographer McDonough so wonderfully and effectively explicates, would be an egregious mistake. Juxtaposed with Milligan‚Äôs story, told with the help of a cornucopia of interviews, including trenchant commentary and extended passages from Milligan himself, are the colorful and significant tales of the developing Off Broadway scene, the birth and rise of the exploitation film industry, and that Ber-nude-a Triangle of ‚Äúall sizzle, no steak?celluloid called the Deuce, or 42nd Street. Chock-full of movie stills, lurid poster art and advertisements, and some great excerpts from Milligan‚Äôs film scripts, McDonough‚Äôs book succeeds overwhelmingly in making the respectability case for Milligan. Undoubtedly, it will also lead many to seek out Milligan‚Äôs work; may y'all have better luck than this reviewer had at your local video store. Clearly, this title will not be everyone‚Äôs bowl of borscht, but it is enthusiastically endorsed for all large public and academic library film and American studies programs. Barry X. Miller, Austin P.L., TX Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc. And from Wikipedia: (this is exactly how I‚Äôm going to wind up) In poor health from late 1989, Andy Milligan died of AIDS in the early morning hours of June 3, 1991, at the Queen of Angeles Medical Center in Los Angeles at age 62. He was buried in an unmarked grave somewhere in Los Angeles, since he was broke at the time of his death and no one who knew him could afford a burial stone or even to have his body cremated.

By studying rats, researchers at ETH Zurich have been able to prove for the first time that our gut instinct has a significant impact on how we react to fear. An unlit, deserted car park at night, footsteps in the gloom. The heart beats faster and the stomach ties itself in knots. We often feel threatening situations in our stomachs. While the brain has long been viewed as the center of all emotions, researchers are increasingly trying to get to the bottom of this proverbial gut instinct. Read more:

71380	Fear	71380.jpg	Anxiety attacks are closely related and often triggered by ‚Äònegative self talk? This is basically a way of mental self harm. 'Ok so I have a job, but WHAT IF I lose it? I‚Äôm healthy BUT, throughout their lives, 1 in 3 people are affected by cancer so I better think about dying everyday. Why not take this delightful fantasy further and actually imagine yourself with no hair due to chemo? As it gets more upsetting, you just go and find the most hurtful, sad, disgusting details in your head until you simply feel like you have actually been through it and you can‚Äôt breathe. You can‚Äôt seem to find the right friends or partner and then BOOM it all goes perfect for once. Promotion, great friends, partner? Well my dears, this is just another reason to worry. 'The more you have, the more you will lose. And YOU WILL LOSE IT. ?As hard as it is to believe - that is bullshit. As hard as it is to stop making these scenarios, just not thinking - IT‚ÄôS POSSIBLE. YOU RULE YOUR MIND. Control what you think about. Command these dark little stories out of your head. Anxiety is a little bitch and it has no clue. Because at the end of it - there is some peace. I regularly freak out a lot and look for sharp objects to possibly let the anxiety out with. But there is no need for that. When I just tell it to go away, long enough - it does. An anxiety attack has been described by doctors as 'one of the most intensely frightening, upsetting, and uncomfortable experiences of a person‚Äôs life and may take days to initially recover from? WHY PUT YOURSELF THROUGH IT???

72327	Fear	72327.jpg	A Letter From Jesus? Strategically set before you is a list of opportunities that I have given out of love and devotion to what I have called you to do. Look closer, beloved. Always look closer. For my leading and prompting are seldom on the surface. Surface level misconceptions transpire from surface level tendencies. Instead look deeper. My hand shall always lead you to ground in which your feet has failed to ever tread. If you stand in a stagnate spot of solitude, you shall miss what I am doing. Instead, move. Step out further than what your natural eyes can conjure up. You are a child of light. You have a Spirit of power. Why should I call you to operate in your strength when I have beckoned you to reign and rule through mine? Every trial and concern should only be an indication that my power has been made perfect in your weakness. Place your hand in mine and let‚Äôs travel a little deeper. Your heart has hardened in an area of trust, and I want to restore your purpose. To when did you believe that I had left? It is important to me that you know fully, my promises that I have bestowed upon you, even before you took shape in your mother‚Äôs womb. Allow me to ask you this question again, beloved. To when did you start believing that I had left you? Surely you questioned my presence, yet I have walked with you for so long. There isn‚Äôt a power on earth nor force in hell that can separate us, and this you know very well. Which voice have you been listening to that has deceivingly began to over power mine in your life? My beautiful one, we are so deeply intertwined within the depths of one another, that surely you shall never find the beginning or trace an assumption to the end. When you were first awakened to me, life began. For I did not restore you, I instead made you new. If I had healed your life, then that would mean you would still have your old life, yet it would be restored. No, no such thing is true. I heal bodies yet you keep the same body. But in the spiritual, restoration is instead replaced with new birth. You are an entirely new creation. This means that all things of the old have passed away and I am inviting you to look upon the NEW thing that I am doing. My child, don‚Äôt you see it? My Spirit dwells inside of you. My Spirit leads you. This is the seal to show that world that you have been purchased at a blood bought price that no man was worthy of purchasing except I. Rest assure my beloved, rest assure. Take these words and make them your foundation: I have never left you. Shall you allow me to secure you in this? May I affirm all of your insecurities and doubts? Let‚Äôs continue to go deeper? I‚Äôve carried you for your entire life. Every step you have taken, every stride that you have gracefully conquered, I have been there. Although it seemed that I had taken a leave of absence is your greatest struggle, I was there. Even stronger than you know. You see, my Father has a love for you that does not wither or fade as time progresses on, so it is the same with me. I have seen the way the Father loves you, and I love how the Father loves. My greatest joy is for you to be secure in my love. I desire your heart to be ravished by mine. I long for the embrace of your unhindered trust to rest in my Truth. But do not be weary beloved. Do not be so hard on yourself. For this is a process and an extensive one at that. You must take heart and know that the good work I have started in you shall be completed before I set my foot to return. Stand tall beautiful one, you are stronger than what your natural strength tries to convince. I have made you a fortress in your family. I have set you as a strong tower to the world. Your words are the power that creates life or death in the lives around you, including yourself. I have given you wisdom and excellence that many are not familiar with. Continue to walk in my grace and meditate on my Word which brings you life and life abundantly at that. But I want you to know this beloved, I want you to stand secure in my affirmation: I am pleased with you. Yes. My heart is filled with joy even as I hear the Father say your name! Rest in my love and know that even at one gaze of your beautiful eyes, I am overtaken. I love you dearly, beautiful one. When all else fails you, be secure in this. I love you.

73335	Fear	73335.jpg	Separation Anxiety Disorder is characterized by an inappropriate or excessive display of fear/distress when faced with being separated from ones home or an attachment figure. As well this anxiety is not in line with the expected developmental age of the person in question.

73560	Fear	73560.jpg	The world is like a ride in an amusement park, and when you choose to go on it you think it‚Äôs real because that‚Äôs how powerful our minds are. The ride goes up and down, around and around, it has thrills and chills, and it‚Äôs very brightly colored, and it‚Äôs very loud, and it‚Äôs fun for a while. Many people have been on the ride a long time, and they begin to wonder, ‚ÄúHey, is this real, or is this just a ride??And other people have remembered, and they come back to us and say, ‚ÄúHey, don‚Äôt worry; don‚Äôt be afraid, ever, because this is just a ride.?And we ?kill those people. ‚ÄúShut him up! I‚Äôve got a lot invested in this ride, shut him up! Look at my furrows of worry, look at my big bank account, and my family. This has to be real.?It‚Äôs just a ride. But we always kill the good guys who try and tell us that, you ever notice that? And let the demons run amok ?But it doesn‚Äôt matter, because it‚Äôs just a ride. And we can change it any time we want. It‚Äôs only a choice. No effort, no work, no job, no savings of money. Just a simple choice, right now, between fear and love. The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love instead see all of us as one. Here‚Äôs what we can do to change the world, right now, to a better ride. Take all that money we spend on weapons and defenses each year and instead spend it feeding and clothing and educating the poor of the world, which it would pay for many times over, not one human being excluded, and we could explore space, together, both inner and outer, forever, in peace. Bill Hicks

As much as I want to think it‚Äôs over and done with I know people still have hate in their hearts towards African American‚Äôs and that is what I think about everyday as an African American female? I think about hate and if it‚Äôs truly gone, I think about racism and how it comes out when people are mad, I think about all the TV shows that use racism as comedy, Overall my mind is forever rolling with thoughts and why wouldn‚Äôt it, it‚Äôs my history.

74828	Fear	74828.jpg	There is some argument over the number of appendages possessed by the Timore Incanta commonly known as ‚ÄúThe Slenderman.?The original myth portrays the entity formed as a tall, thin, male humanoid with numerous additional limbs sprouting from what seems to be its back. This fortean physiology is neither well-documented nor well-defined, not even the amount. Composed of material as varied as smoke, ink, or corporeal darkness, the properties have been liken to tree branches, spider legs, and tentacles. Some would even argue there are two separate Timore Incanata based upon this, ‚ÄúThe Slenderman?and ‚ÄúThe Operator,?and that they are, in fact, not the same entity. ‚ÄúThe Operator,?known from the Marble Hornets videos, is never seen displaying the extra limbs. In fact, never once in these videos is the term ‚Äúslender man?mentioned. However, one can not deny the many similarities. Can there be such thing as canon to post-modern mythology? Is it too new and still evolving or is it simply a matter of the subject matter when considering the Incarnatus Timore Fabulari? Ultimately, perhaps this is for the individual to decide.

74882	Fear	74882.jpg	Fibro?Fear? Frustration! When you live with chronic illness there is always fear. There is fear that you‚Äôll get worse, fear that you‚Äôll be in such terrible pain forever, fear that you won‚Äôt be able to do this or that, there is always fear associated with a chronic illness. It is a fear that is difficult to explain to someone who hasn‚Äôt experienced a similar illness but it is very real. It is so easy for it to be so much more than this though. New pains bring new concerns. Symptoms that we cannot explain or have not had in the past make us wonder what more we might have to endure. And then when our doctor or doctors can‚Äôt find an answer for us that makes sense our fear often turns to panic and frustration. Read the whole article here

75187	Fear	75187.jpg	The very first thing I remember in my early childhood is a flame, a blue flame jumping off a gas stove somebody lit?I was three years old?I felt fear, real fear, for the first time in my life, but I remember it also like some kind of adventure, some kind of weird joy, too. I guess that experience took me someplace in my head I hadn'tt been before, to some frontier, the edge, maybe of everything possible?The fear I had was almost like an invitation, a challenge to go forward into something I knew nothing about, that‚Äôs where I think my personal philosophy of life?started with that moment.. In my mind I have always believed and thought since then that my motion had to be forward, away from the heat of that flame. - Miles Davis photo credit jazz.com

75859	Fear	75859.jpg	‚ÄúWhat if?can be a terrible thing, depending on what you place on the end of it. However, when you remember that everything that comes after a ‚Äúwhat if? unless it is a statement of a known fact, is fantasy, then you can use it to your advantage. The truth about fear is that it is not an emotion. Fear is thought, a fantasy that something bad is going to happen. Anxiety is the emotion produced by that fantasy. It does not matter if fear is based on something bad that actually did happen in the past. It is still fantasy. Caution is not the same as fear because it is planning for a probability based on evidence that it is likely to happen. Fear is unreasonable, and it is possible to be afraid of anything. I have seen people freak out over a butterfly. Fear does not discern if the reason for it is legitimate, because it does not use logic. When we listen to logic, fear subsides. When we use humor or positive thinking, fear subsides. For instance, when we know that everything that comes after ‚Äúwhat if?is fantasy, we can start attaching other things to the fantasy. We could think, ‚ÄúWhat if my kid gets caught in a school shooting?? or we could think, ‚ÄúWhat if Donald Trump announces that he is having sexual reassignment surgery??You can attach anything to your ‚ÄúWhat if? so why not attach something fun, or interesting, or positive to it. You might as well say, ‚ÄúWhat if I win a hundred million in the lottery?? as to say ‚ÄúWhat if I go bankrupt??Regardless of any evidence that either could occur, one attachment to ‚Äúwhat if?is as valid as any other. The question is whether you want to allow fear to rule your life or whether you want to rule your life. If you want to rule your life, you must first take responsibility for your thinking and understand that all thought is a choice. Courage is the choice we make when we stop listening to fear. karlyletomms.com

75931	Fear	75931.jpg	Around one in the morning they brought out the riot police. At one point, they pushed the crowd out of the park, killed the floodlights, and surrounded us with officers armed with beanbag guns, rubber bullets, tear gas canisters, and nightsticks. That was one of the scariest moments of my life. Including the time I fell off a cliff. There is nothing to describe the loneliness of sitting in a quiet ring of people waiting to be attacked by those whose jobs are to protect us, attacked for defending our own rights. There are also no words for the sense of camaraderie that builds between you and those with whose arms you are linked. You know you have all made this decision, and there is no turning back. As we sat there and passed around vinegar to soak our shirts and bandannas with to counteract the effects of tear gas, it occurred to me how strange it was that despite my fear, there was no question in my mind as to whether I wanted to do this. Hannah ended up with a gas mask, lucky duck.

76326	Fear	76326.jpg	Life is a constant reflection, a reflection that happens on many levels. From us genuinely trying to figure out who we are from within, while becoming what our reality reflects back to us, ie: family, friends, social acceptance. In order to get the full sense of who you are, the mind can not be allowed to interfere with your perspective, for within your heart lies the true answer of Who and What you Are. We just need to silence the mind, so we can hear the truth emenating from our Hearts. This is all part of the process of Letting Go, God is more than Religion, and you are more than what you Think.

76758	Fear	76758.jpg	New Post has been published on You Say This, God Says That Throughout life, we love to feed off of the thoughts and lies we tell ourselves in our head over and over again. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do it.?‚ÄúI‚Äôm not worth it.?‚ÄúNo one loves me.?Sound familiar? We love telling ourselves lies that linger in our head and tear us down. These thoughts are thoughts of the world that society loves to tell us. It‚Äôs easy for a thought like this to repeat in our heads when we‚Äôre feeling down in the first place. God never wants us to feel the pain of feeling like we‚Äôre alone and not enough. There are so many things that we say that God proves false. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do it.?? ‚ÄúYou can do all things through me.? We all have our struggles and times when we think we can‚Äôt keep going. It‚Äôs human nature to want to give up on something when it becomes too hard, whatever it may be. God wants us to know that through him, anything is possible. Matthew 19:26 says, ‚ÄúJesus looked at them and said, ‚ÄòWith man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.‚Äô?There are so many things that have occurred in my life that I can attribute 100% to God. I know that so many of my circumstances are because they appeared through God and in God. So please, don‚Äôt give up just yet! God is working without you even realizing it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm all alone.?? ‚ÄúI am always with you.? The world does a good job at making us feel lonely and afraid. While friends and even family can leave you all alone, God never leaves your side. Isaiah 41:10 says, ‚ÄúSo do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.? Not only is he with us always, but he gives us the strength and power to get us through each and every day. Talk to him and lean on his guidance. You‚Äôll realize you aren‚Äôt as alone as you think you are. ‚ÄúNo one loves me.?? ‚ÄúI love you unconditionally.? How much does God love us? An incomprehensible amount. We, as humans, can‚Äôt even feel the amount of love that God has for us. He is the perfect, caring father that loves each and every one of us unconditionally. Romans 8:38-39 says, ‚ÄúFor I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.? This verse reassures me of God‚Äôs love every time I feel like it starts to fade. God‚Äôs love never fades! Nothing can separate us from Him and how much he cares for us. He is the most loving a father could possibly be! Next time one of these thoughts pops into your head, remember the truth of who God is. He is loving, caring, honest, trustworthy, and so many other things. Now it‚Äôs up to you to believe that! ?Chelsea

A state of ambedo, melancholy, or even bliss it strikes you into a trance. A moment that seems to never end? A young woman is taken, kidnapped, swept away from her peaceful life amongst others to become pawns for a relentless killer. A Jack the Ripper, an Issei Sagawa, a nameless beast prowls, creating a myriad of puzzles in his ultimate game. A mysterious man from the shadows approaches her and asks for her help. Little does she know that she is not a pawn, but a King in this torrid game of chess. Through rounds of loss, love, fury, sorrow and bliss, Saiya is determined to live, fighting with all her desperation to survive. Reader‚Äôs digression is advised.

76813	Fear	76813.jpg	No one is immune to tough days. I work with a lot of people who are required to be top of their game, everyday. literally everyday.

The more you hold in an the less peers you have and often the more competitive your role is. (Often resulting in isolation & reduced support) This is why so many and business owners mismanage or can‚Äôt switch off when they need to.

76968	Fear	76968.jpg	A year ago, almost to this day (June 25), 9 of us got stuck in an elevator after brunch. It felt like an eternity. I couldn‚Äôt move any part of my body because someone else was already there. Just standing. And waiting. The minutes passed until the firefighters arrived and rescued us, and we celebrated in the sunlight with our feet on the ground and with room to breathe. Checking the time, it had only been 10 minutes. Maybe it feels like we‚Äôre not moving, as though we‚Äôre in a rut that extends into weeks, months, and even years. But, if you keep living and doing your best, when you finally find your feet planted on new ground and can look back, that period of pause, of waiting, wasn‚Äôt actually that long.

Marcela was so scared she got sick after the scene. She couldn‚Äôt stop stutter for three days. sSe didn‚Äôt want to die because of the stutter, and she got pain in her stomach also, so she prayed the Holy Child of Atocha. Thanks to the saint she got recovered, the fear and the stutter have gone.

77274	Fear	77274.jpg	Recently, I had a Coronary Angioplasty (heart procedure). I thought how could my heart be blocked 80% when I was doing everything right? After my heart attack last year, I was dedicated to eating right and working out 3-4 times a week. Some weeks I would work out all 7 days. All my blood tests, x-rays, and Eco tests showed that I was doing GOOD. Low cholesterol, lowered A1C, EKG‚Äôs?everything looked great. But I knew something was wrong. So, what caused the blockage? Well, our body‚Äôs naturally tries to heal itself. Last year, I received two stents. Unfortunately, my body saw these are foreign objects and tried to reject one, which caused the blockage. Man. I was afraid after I learned this. Because I had no control over that. It‚Äôs easier to digest when I know all I have to do is ‚ÄúX Y Z?to prevent it. But I have to remind myself to not worry about things I have NO control over. And I can‚Äôt stop living because I almost died twice. I have to embrace and enjoy this journey. I refuse to live in fear. I‚Äôll find a way to use that fear to work for my good. It was by His grace and mercy, AGAIN. I don‚Äôt know why, but I‚Äôm glad He keep on keeping me. I will continue to do what I need to do to live a healthy, evolve, grow, learn, stress-free life. I will LIVE this life! The rest?God is in control. Walking by FAITH, not sight. üö∂üôå üôèüòá?

77981	Fear	77981.jpg	Hold me tight when ascending Did you know Momo the hedgehog felt more awkward (more stressed maybe?) when ascending than descending? Case-study Evidence? Experiment While Momo‚Äôs eyes being open ascending at 30cm/second on my hand, her corrugators (the muscles above eyes) instinctively contracted. It might signal, ?I am scared! Let me close the eyes first so that they couldn‚Äôt see.? Experiment While her eyes being open descending at the same speed, her corrugators were relatively relaxed comparing with those in Exp. It might signal, : ‚ÄúWell, what are you doing? I am not scared.? Experiment While covering Momo‚Äôs eyes by my left hand and ascending at the same speed on my right, surprisingly the same result as Exp. Why? What do I say? My explanation is that these animals are innately ready to roll in a ball while experiencing something like a free fall to self defense from the point of final impact. Cushion, right? However, while ascending, they may not know what to do with their body, except covering their eyes. Contracting eye muscles are an automatic self-defense presentation of hedgehogs anyway. What make it meaningful (or significant) in terms of fears dealing with ascending versus descending? Implication? The stress generated by sudden environmental ascendance may associate with hedgehog‚Äôs vision. Because hedgehog‚Äôs vision is relatively poor and greatly sensitive to movements, Momo‚Äôs fear of the ascendance might be more likely initiated by visible changes, whilst fear of sudden environmental descendance, such as free fall, more likely geographic. Such presentation and effect need to be elucidated by future observations and a greater sample size. P.S. Let me know your observations-if any. I don‚Äôt think anyone would be interested in what I say in this blog, but it‚Äôs worth-noting some cautions below - just in case. Caution: Do not repeat this experiment unless you know what you are doing. Caution: Do not repeat this experiment unless you are an adult.

77996	Fear	77996.jpg	associations of my fears	
78000	Fear	78000.jpg	I‚Äôve always asked people what they think the most prominent human emotion is? Always have got an wide array of answers ranging from happiness to grief, all due to different reasons. But you know what I think? I think that fear is and has always been the most prevalent emotion in a being, not just humans but all organisms. And this fear makes us do crazy things. We earn because we‚Äôre scared of poverty, we eat because we‚Äôre scared of malnutrition, we love because we‚Äôre scared to be alone, we wage wars because we‚Äôre scared that someone will take away something that belongs to us, we push people away because we‚Äôre too scared to be attached, and to feel. We thrive because we‚Äôre scared of absence, of death. We live because we are afraid to know what happens otherwise. This fear pushes over the edge and makes us try harder to thrive, this fear is what makes us realize we‚Äôre alive. The choices we make because of this, trigger a domino effect on all our lives. And these choices are what we have to live with. If I had the choice to go back in time, I wouldn‚Äôt go to see the Queens performing live, although Bohemian Rhapsody still gives me goosebumps each time. I wouldn‚Äôt go to live those old moments with everyone, although I‚Äôd love to. There‚Äôs only one place I‚Äôd go back to when we were unaware of each other before the night when we set upon our own domino effect, just so I could meet you sooner and tell you sooner ‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs me. Let‚Äôs go out. I‚Äôm afraid. ? I‚Äôm afraid of losing time. But, I guess that‚Äôs what makes me human.

We ask ourselves, ‚ÄòWho am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous??Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won‚Äôt feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It‚Äôs not just in some of us; it‚Äôs in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others." -Marianne Williamson (at Rufskin Store)

Sadly, living this way only causes is to become out of touch with our feelings, able to express either extreme feelings of sadness or anger. I have written about how you can get back in touch with your feelings and learning healthier ways of expressing how you feel. Visit my Medium page: medium.com/ndidi.health (at Lagos, Nigeria)

The rush I felt when going full speed into the dark abyss was equal parts excitement and fear. Having little to no visibility (photo edited to enhance visibility), and using only my minimal skill it was quite challenging to stay atop my board through puddles and over cracks, but I did. It felt like an accurate representation of my life.

78734	Fear	78734.jpg	To the shirt I haven‚Äôt changed in 3 days. Yes, I haven‚Äôt changed this shirt in three days, it‚Äôs been 72 hours, I don‚Äôt really know why, maybe because there has been no need to do so, or probably a change is so obnoxious now that this shirt which has been a constant for the last three days feels home, or maybe because I haven‚Äôt slept in more than three days, or I haven‚Äôt sweat enough to make this stink, or it could be a thing which I don‚Äôt even know. The good thing about being vulnerable is that you learn to coexist with your fears and loneliness instead of combating it, the need to lust over strength to overcome this phase gives up and you seem to be okay being a lost warrior. For the warriors, losing wars is as normal as winning them, wounds and scars are as natural as breathing, but what is not as normal and natural is being deprived of weapons and commanders it‚Äôs difficult, to be a warrior you must always have your guard on. But, for the self proclaimed warriors the ones who feel like us, those who crave to put their guards down as they make love to their anxieties and fears as if that‚Äôs the most lustrous thing ever. What are they? Un-warrior like warriors? (at Asian News International (ANI))	
78736	Fear	78736.jpg	FEAR Red light, green light. My hands can‚Äôt seem to do anything by themselves. My sister washes my body, she feeds me breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and she even guides me by the arm as I slowly build my own home. But I stop sometimes and I start sometimes, so it‚Äôs nowhere near complete. I‚Äôm never fully committed to anything that matters, maybe because of the weight of my disability. So I drown my lack of purpose with a dark bottle and some moldy cigarettes after a long day‚Äôs work. My sister scolds me when that happens.

79149	Fear	79149.jpg	Think of love as a light that shines into the darkness, and you control the switch as to whether the light shines, or it does not. Eternal love, like the sun, only shines. We can turn away from it, like the earth does every night, we can retreat from it, like going into a cave, or we can try to block it, like a thunderstorm, but we cannot extinguish the light. Our own light shines only if we want it to, or maybe divine light shines through us when we allow it to, but we control the switch, and either it is on, or it is off. If we turn it off, there will be darkness in our lives, if we turn it on, even if there is darkness in our lives, that darkness is dispersed. Darkness always retreats from light. So, either we love, or we do not. ACIM teaches that there are really only two human states of being, love and fear, and either we are in one or the other at any given moment. Every human emotion and intent falls into one category or the other. Kindness, compassion and understanding, of course, fall into the category of love. Resentment, defensiveness and malice fall into the category of fear. We switch back and forth in various ways and degrees throughout life. The goal would be to get into a state of love and remain in it as often as possible, and for as long as possible, to turn the switch on, and leave it on as long as we can. When we do that, we see differently, our path is made clear. Like being able to see, instead of stumbling around in the darkness, love shines a light onto our problems, and allows us to see them a different way. The more we remember that we control the switch as to whether love is turned on or off, the more often will our problems be settled in a way that fear could never accomplish, and we decide, moment by moment whether we will allow fear or love be the dominant force in our life. karlyletomms.com

79162	Fear	79162.jpg	Restlessness and Restoration. A little while back I went to Turi again with my girlfriend and there was a little contempt I felt after the whole trip. I mean sure it was relaxing and it was her birthday *yay* but there‚Äôs a small part of me that didn‚Äôt feel completely restful whilst we were there. I don‚Äôt usually think too much on holidays and I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs probably the whole idea surrounding vacations anyway. The weird thing is how this only hits me now when I‚Äôm 4 weeks into the school semester. Restlessness is when every night, without fail, I get the urge to just walk off or take a scooter (which I‚Äôve been doing pretty frequently) somewhere else in school just to take my mind off things. Not that I‚Äôve had much on my mind anyway at this point in time. Fell sick recently and I guess that‚Äôs been a push factor for me to write this too anyway. I was wondering about the root cause and I thought back to this view in Turi and I realized something that I hadn‚Äôt noticed back then either. Reality closing in on the edges of something temporary. I was surrounded by the reality of time passing by. Youth is something that we only have so much of and how do we make the best of what we have? By doing more than everyone else? Taking in more sights, more experiences than everyone else? I don‚Äôt know to be perfectly honest. When I was looking at this sunset, I wasn‚Äôt thinking about how much time I had left or what not, but I was taking in every moment. Or I thought I was anyway. I had spent the better part of this beautiful moment trying to get a good picture of myself and my girlfriend. I‚Äôm actually pretty glad I still managed to snap the last moments of the horizon‚Äôs colors before it disappeared into the next timezone. Thinking back to that moment, I think I‚Äôve found out what restlessness in a physical form would be like. The idea of trying too hard for something that would ultimately yield less fruit. The idea that I would miss some sort of metaphorical sunset. 4 weeks into my second semester of my second year in a university in Singapore. Somehow all this uncertainty coalesces into something more elusive. Harder to track or label with just a single emotion. Where am I going to be 5 years in the future? I‚Äôve heard friends mentioning their potential plans to further their studies, take on teaching as a career. It leaves me in constant wonder, where all this certainty comes from? Where being in this particular generation would lead an average person to? Not a Zuckerberg. Not a Musk. Not any prolific personality. Just an average Joe, and even so, there are Joes more renown than myself. How do we place a print on this planet? My second ‚ÄúR?for the sake of interesting titling is Restoration. I actually thought of this because of a module called ‚ÄúRestoration and 18th Century Literature?that I‚Äôm taking right now. It‚Äôs all environmental and ecological and stuff, but nothing else much that has to do with the meaning of the word that I‚Äôm implying. I guess I‚Äôm trying to restore parts of what I assumed was going to be motivation/goals/objectives in my life that I had initially wielded. In the army, I was so certain that I would‚Äôve figured it out by now. So, many scooter rides, late-night walks and moments of contemplation that I‚Äôve had over the course of a year and several months, I‚Äôve come to accept that I‚Äôm probably never going to consider anything as concrete. Plans will change, just as people will. Friends will come and go. People who you thought would never leave are gone, just as those who‚Äôd you never have imagined yourself close to are now the ones you‚Äôd never let go. Time to shed the restless and time to figure out that I‚Äôm never going to find my inspiration by resting less. Smile more, be happier with the little things, spend time with people who push you further and higher. Be more to restore. Goodnight.

79464	Fear	79464.jpg	Had a fairly vivid dream the other night - that hasn‚Äôt happened in a while! My friends were fighting 3 of 4 challengers - we had to escape. I saw the way to the 4th, in a pit in the floor. I ran to face it - and it found me before I could drop down. This challenger would kill me if I so much as looked at it. I could do nothing while its darkness slowly surrounded me. So, I kept still. I even took this meditative stance. The challenger taunted me for not fighting while my friends showed more strength. I couldn‚Äôt breathe, but I kept still. Everything went silent. The floor, the walls, the pit, all vanished. I felt nothing but the position of my hands and my racing heartbeat. I thought I‚Äôd been eaten, swallowed in the darkness. Suddenly, the world reappeared - I gasped feeling the floor beneath me. I opened my eyes. The darkness was gone, and I‚Äôd reached the bottom of the pit - our goal. We were free! That‚Äôs when I woke up. I‚Äôm not sure what it means, but I feel a little stronger. :)

I slept for 45 minutes total. Her fever peaked at 39.5 (103 F), her nose is running and she is coughing too. She hasn‚Äôt had as much as a rash since she was born so this is pretty rough for us allüòî Seeing her in pain and not being able to anything about it is so awful. Eye is much better today and even though she barely slept she‚Äôs in super good spirits - picking today of all days to walk 10+ steps on her own! My little moon baby. I‚Äôm exhausted. From worry, mostly. Fittingly enough I wrote a blog last night title about my obsessive fear that something awful is going to happen to her. Typing out my fears was helpful but even when she fell asleep I couldn‚Äôt sleep - I just laid there watching her chest rise and fall with every breath. Ah, motherhood.

But deep down inside I know worry serves no purpose here. So - taking slow, deep breaths - I‚Äôm turning this over to God. God gave her father and me this child to love and teach and help her grow into a beautiful woman who makes a meaningful impact on this world. That‚Äôs a big job, but I know He never expected us to do it alone. He has been there every step of the way. He will be there tomorrow at the hospital, guiding the skilled hands of the doctors. He will be present in the kindness and attentiveness of the nurses. When anxiety and fear take hold, we will turn to Him for strength and comfort. Times like these are when we need to let our faith be bigger than our fears. Let go and let God.

Growing up might have been pretty easy for Skylar, however, a crucial car crash changes her life in a complete way. Besides having to deal with the pain of the loss of her mother, moving in and living with her aunt Amber in the countryside took her by surprise and shock. For a 19-year-old woman, Skylar thought it was too much hard to keep up with the studies and also take care of her 8-year-old brother Jonathan, who has a serious disease Just when things were getting tougher, Nathan Peters appears in her life by mistake.

80878	Fear	80878.jpg	Hey guys! I know I‚Äôve posted this on my insta-story this week, but I thought I would go ahead and share this post this on my Instagram page since it‚Äôs been awhile now since I‚Äôve last done so. Anyway, I remembered briefly reading this book back in my creative writing class in college and just now I finished reading this book yesterday. This book has definitely opened up my eyes and my mind about creative people and their fear of pursuing their own art. I can‚Äôt tell you how much I relate to some of the topics that were covered and I think a lot of people don‚Äôt realize how much of a struggle can be dealing with your own art. Not just because of the criticisms people give back to others?or their own work, but sometimes people can be very hard on themselves and believe it or not there is some kind of phycology behind it as well. If anyone is having a hard time with painting/drawing, photography, acting, singing, creative writing, etc. I highly recommend reading this book because this is encouraging to step outside of my comfort zone already.

80993	Fear	80993.jpg	Proverbs 29:13 I‚Äôve been really struggling with jealousy and insecurity lately. There‚Äôs a girl who my boyfriend used to like before we started dating, and very soon I‚Äôm going to be seeing her regularly. And it is totally stressing me out. I‚Äôm worried she‚Äôs going to flirt with him and try to charm him into falling out of love with me. Which I know is totally crazy. But I know that people are flawed and weak sinners. And I know my greatest flaw is certainly my insecurity and thinking about it makes me start to feel an anxiety attack coming on. But reading this really calmed me down. It reminded me that God created ever single person, and disliking someone out of fear is so utterly un-Christlike. So I‚Äôm going to do my best to pray through it and treat her like Christ would, and pour love into the situation instead of fear. If you have a spare moment, please pray for me and ask that God give me the strength to overcome my weak human emotions and fill me with His type of love for His people. Amen!

She is still quite young, owns a wonderful curvy shape and a gorgeous backside, nevertheless, she is also one of the most dreaded punishers of the school. Her skill and harshness when using the cane (what happens quite often) is well known all around the secondary school, so pupils openly give way to her whenever she passes by, avoiding any visual contact or chat with her, you know, just in case? I wonder, if she haughtily thinks that owning that marvelous bottom, gives her the right to ruin the boys?ones.

81091	Fear	81091.jpg	Just me, my tea and my (favorite shoes) sitting here, taking a minute to regroup and ponder today‚Äôs goals while waiting for my first session of the day. It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of the work day. To start things off in a rush. But I‚Äôve found that taking 5 to practice the Art of Nothing or listen to a script really helps me feel better. Choosing how I want to be in the world is tough, it requires being present, and making an effort not to play out bad habits and reactive patterns. I bet you have some habits or typical reactions to your daily hustle you‚Äôd like to change. What are they? And what would you like to replace them with? Leave a comment, let me know.

81388	Fear	81388.jpg	Last night I was experiencing a strange feeling in my chest, anxiety was blocking my thoughts and I couldn‚Äôt be able to do what I was supposed to. Sometimes we find ourselves insecure and afraid of the new? I think I‚Äôve been there many times this year actually. In my experience, being afraid is the first sign of having a step out of our comfort zone, it means that we‚Äôre doing things we‚Äôre not used to, it means that we are discovering new paths, new experiences?It means that we are living. One of the best parts of being afraid is when once you run to ‚Äútackle?it, it runs away inmediatly. You succeed.

81637	Fear	81637.jpg	A BAO A QU I saw him waiting there. Prince Charming, waiting at the bottom of the stairs, ready to meet his true love. All he had to do was climb. I sat on the first step, too eager, forgetting myself for a moment and nearly latching myself onto the poor boy. It had been quite a while since I had fed. My many tentacles scuttled in anticipation, creating an ominous tapping sound that the boy could not hear. He took one breath and finally, finally, he started up the stairs. He was more muscly than his predecessor, perhaps he could last through it all. I needed him to succeed in this quest. It was the only way for me to be truly satisfied. My hunger had overcome me far too often these days. I had caught myself about to jump from the bottom step more than ten times. Even knowing that leaving the last step meant certain death, my body wished for it. My mind did not. The boy had defeated the other two curses that the witch had placed on this tower. He killed the troll that guarded the drawbridge. He had slain the dragon that lay below in the dungeons. Now all he needed to do was defeat the final curse. Me. The natives refer to me as A Bao A Qu, meaning soul sucker. I can‚Äôt help it. I have always been hungry, and there is no other way for me to eat. With each step he climbs, I feed more and more. I feel tears on my face, tears of relief, tears of finally feeling satisfaction. My hunger no longer burns within me. It is subdued, for now. I try to slow down, but I find myself gorging on him, filling myself quickly, weakening him. I see now that he will not succeed. I have taken too much from him. His skin has paled, his eyes hollowed, his will diminished. I regret it immediately. He stops, slumps against the steps, eyes unseeing. He is dead. You fucking idiot, I berate myself.

81675	Fear	81675.jpg	Failing When I came to London my biggest fear was failing. I was so afraid of failing and having to go home that I was afraid of even trying my best. Eventually I built up the courage to throw myself into it though and fail.. and fail I did, again and again. I started realising that I learned something new every time I failed and got stronger each time. By the end fear of failure disappeared and I started appreciating each part of the process I‚Äôm going through and not being desperately afraid of falling on my ass. Because I know I can always get up! Set goals! Fail, fail, fail and then by the end we will succeed! (at Kensington, United Kingdom)

Climbing is not my usual outdoor activity (I‚Äôm admittedly scared of heights, put me back in the water) but I showed up for myself, pushed through to the end and once my heart rate slowed I felt so brave and accomplished. I want to apply that feeling and motivation to other aspects of my life more. Spending time in the outdoors is often such a great personal learning journey. (at Acadia National Park)

81922	Fear	81922.jpg	The Science of Fright: Why We Love to be Scared Fear may be as old as life on Earth. It is a fundamental, deeply wired reaction, evolved over the history of biology, to protect organisms against perceived threat to their integrity or existence. Fear may be as simple as a cringe of an antenna in a snail that is touched, or as complex as existential anxiety in a human. Whether we love or hate to experience fear, it‚Äôs hard to deny that we certainly revere it ?devoting an entire holiday to the celebration of fear. Thinking about the circuitry of the brain and human psychology, some of the main chemicals that contribute to the ‚Äúfight or flight?response are also involved in other positive emotional states, such as happiness and excitement. So, it makes sense that the high arousal state we experience during a scare may also be experienced in a more positive light. But what makes the difference between getting a ‚Äúrush?and feeling completely terrorized? We are psychiatrists who treat fear and study its neurobiology. Our studies and clinical interactions, as well as those of others, suggest that a major factor in how we experience fear has to do with the context. When our ‚Äúthinking?brain gives feedback to our ‚Äúemotional?brain and we perceive ourselves as being in a safe space, we can then quickly shift the way we experience that high arousal state, going from one of fear to one of enjoyment or excitement. When you enter a haunted house during Halloween season, for example, anticipating a ghoul jumping out at you and knowing it isn‚Äôt really a threat, you are able to quickly relabel the experience. In contrast, if you were walking in a dark alley at night and a stranger began chasing you, both your emotional and thinking areas of the brain would be in agreement that the situation is dangerous, and it‚Äôs time to flee! But how does your brain do this? The Conversation ‚ÄúThe Science of Fright: Why We Love to be Scared.?NeuroscienceNews. NeuroscienceNews, 30 October 2017.

81973	Fear	81973.jpg	‚Ä¶But what if the music stops? If every aspiring music professional were asked to list their biggest concerns regarding their chosen career path the top response would undoubtedly be the unpredictability of the industry. Even if you do everything right there is no guarantee there will be a place for you six months from now, let alone five or ten years down the line. That ambiguity is hard for many, and for good reason. Humans are conditioned to seek comfort and security. We want to make careers out of what we love and we want those careers to last as long as we have to work. Many jobs work this way, but not music. <!-- more --> Professional comfort zones do not exist in the world of music. The sound that sells well today may not sell at all in six months. The startup you move across the country to work at could lose funding overnight. The venue you launch to build a local scene close or lose its license. The band you hitch your career to may fall apart before they achieve greatness. The possibilities are endless, and each will leave you questioning what to do next. If anyone tell you this fear does not keep them up at night they are either a liar or someone using sleep aides. The fear of music industry downturn lives inside every current professional because they or someone they know has experience such hardship in the past. It happens regularly, not all at once across the business, but in various pockets as the ebb and flow of consumerism dictates. Even the best in their field feel the pinch, and for some it becomes too much to bare. Industry influencers love to speak of a day in the distant future where such concerns do not exist, but the realty of right now is that no one knows what the next year will bring. Maybe streaming services will continue to grow, and in doing so be able to better compensate talent, but that is not a guarantee. Maybe festivals will continue to be lucrative events, or maybe the recent massacre in Las Vegas will keep average consumers away. Again, the possibilities are endless. You cannot stop living today due to fear over what may happen in the future. There are no guarantees things will work out, but the fact you know that going in is an advantage. When others give up because things become difficult you will persevere because the struggle is part of the journey. The loss of an opportunity will not devastate you because you will understand another lies just around the corner. The odds will always be stacked against you, but that does not mean your dreams are impossible. Most people do not realize just how cutthroat the entertainment business really is until they‚Äôve spent years of their lives trying to make their dreams work. Don‚Äôt be one of those who find themselves feeling burnt out by twenty-five with nothing to show for all your hard effort. Dig in deep now, push forward, and do not let up. There will always be a chance the music stops, leaving you without a paycheck and a lot of necessary sacrifices, but that possibility can inspire as much at scares. Use the knowledge nothing is guaranteed to your advantage and work to share the reality you seek in life. You might not get there, but it is better to give something your all and fall short than to never try because you fear what could go wrong. Everything is chaos. Accept this fact and forge ahead. There is no other way to live.

It takes less effort to walk around the block than it does to train for a marathon. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä But over time the price you pay for the easy choice is higher. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä Take the difficult road now‚Ä¶while you‚Äôre young‚Ä¶while you can‚Ä¶and most importantly‚Ä¶while you still have the choice.

82207	Fear	82207.jpg	I can honestly say, I hate you. I rarely use that word, but that is how strongly I feel. I first met you when I was about ten years old, and a year later, you took my great grandfather. My whole world crumbled, and my life was never the same. You went away for a while and I was happy to be rid of you. Lately, you‚Äôve been lurking around, striking around me, at my friends and family. Now, you‚Äôre back and with a vengeance. I wish you never existed. I wish that no family ever has to go through watching you destroy someone they love. I wish that no one would ever again have to utter your name from their lips. From the bottom of my heart, I HATE YOU CANCER!!! And, for that matter, I‚Äôm pretty sure my mom hates you too! From her to you, üñïüèº

82237	Fear	82237.jpg	New Post has been published on If You Fear Friday the 13th here‚Äôs what we know about You It‚Äôs Friday the 13th, and since Halloween is just a few weeks away, this one feels just a little more meaningful. So if you‚Äôre uneasy today, listen up. I‚Äôve got a list of five things science says about you if you fear Friday the 13th ? Your fear has a name. The fear of Friday the 13th is called frigg-a-tri-skai-dek-a-phobia. And if you‚Äôre afraid of the number 13 in general, that‚Äôs tri-skai-dek-a-phobia. You might be scared about what you can‚Äôt control. That‚Äôs why so many people alter their plans today, to try to avoid being unlucky. If you‚Äôre a little on edge today, you‚Äôre normal. Having a ritual like not walking under a ladder or avoiding black cats today is silly ?but it‚Äôs probably not indicative of any sort of mental illness. If you‚Äôre SUPER anxious though, it could be a problem. If you stay in bed all day in fear that anything you do will be cursed, there might be some deeper issues at play. You‚Äôre disrupting the economy. It‚Äôs estimated that around $900 MILLION is lost in business every Friday the 13th ?from all the people who decide not to fly, go to work, or leave their house at all.

I can‚Äôt explain how these things affect me, but I work only two miles from where it happened. I can see it from my office. The closer I am the more it hurts. There is still so much energy and pain radiating from that space. It‚Äôs soul crushing. Every time I go to work, I take some of that energy and pain home where it fuels my restless mind into fear and anger and hatred. I‚Äôm holding the weight of thousands of people inside me, the fear they left in that place, and I don‚Äôt know how to stop it.

83521	Fear	83521.jpg	The 5th Too precious to not care : A few weeks ago I read one of those apocalyptic articles, assuming that already within the next 30 years our world as we know it won‚Äôt exist anymore. Even the deniers won‚Äôt succeed anymore at denying what is so visible. Climate change - is happening. When you are on your own, that is scary, but do-able. But since I am with the little dwarf, the thought of catastrophies and war is unbearable, and scares me on the deepest level. Well, it‚Äôs nothing new that scientists say the best you can do is to simply not have any children. And well?I guess they are right. Or to at least not have too many. There is this little being now, and I try my best to tell him about animals, plants, and his role in this all. But will I be able to raise him in a way that will not contibute to this big industrial mess? And to which degree am I contributing to it? Is it selfish wishing another baby in the future, so that he would have a brother or sister? Is it irresponsible? : I want to protect both, this planet and the little universe that is the dwarfie. If only I had a guide book how to do that.

83539	Fear	83539.jpg	Perspective, man?it changes everything. # What‚Äôs your perspective on life, your job, or yourself? Does your mindset help or hinder you? # For years my mindset had me fearing that I wasn‚Äôt good enough, that I was an impostor. I learned to change that and so much good has come of it. It‚Äôs amazing to feel so free. I‚Äôm free to fail and free to succeed. I‚Äôm free to pursue my dreams without that voice holding me back. # Everywhere I turn nowadays I see posts about mindset. I think it‚Äôs great. Mindset being what I do both as psychologist and as a coach?I realize how much your thoughts and beliefs can either hold you back or propel you forward. # Which is exactly why I dedicate a full third of my coaching process to understanding and shifting your mindset. # Honestly, if you‚Äôve been feeling stuck, afraid to go for what you want, afraid to trust yourself or feel confident about your choices, it‚Äôs probably mindset. And mindset can be changed, let me show you how.ü§∏ü§∏ü§∏

83548	Fear	83548.jpg	I am scared to death when I see üêùbees flying around, such little insects are my biggest fear! and apparently it‚Äôs a common fear which has a name üëπ(melissophobia). Fears can be greatly allayed when we know the truth, so that we can put everything in perspective. Phantoms are scary until we realise they are only phantoms. So what are the facts? Knowing more about bees and their benefits, may help allay our fears. So that‚Äôs why I want to talk about how such scary creatures have a positive impact in our life. HONEYüçØ: Even if we‚Äôre not fans of bees, we have to give them credit for creating one of the most delicious substances on earth. Not only is honey great for sweetening a spot of tea, it also has some incredible properties that set it apart from all other food products. üëëHoney never spoils. üåøIt is medicinal. üíéHoney is good for environment and economy. Bees pollinate $20 billion worth of U.S. crops each year, and approximately one third of all food eaten by Americans is either directly or indirectly derived from honey bee pollination. BENEFITS FOR LIFEüåç: The biggest number of types of üåªplants, fruits and vegetables are dependent upon bees for pollination. And the livestock that are dependent upon bee-pollinated forage plants, such as clover. No human activity or ingenuity could ever replace the work of bees and yet it is largely taken for granted. It is often not realized just how easy it is to help or hinder their effectiveness as crop pollinators nor how much is lost by their loss. In other words, Bees play an important role in the life cycle. We should all give them üíñhearty thanks, because, without bees, we would have ceased to exist long ago. Humans eat their honey, use their wax, and rely on bees to help our food grow, benefiting us all. Let‚Äôs be grateful next time we see a bee flying around us. üåíüåïüåò ‚ÄúExpose yourself to your deepest fear; after that, fear has no power, and the fear of freedom shrinks and vanishes. You are free.‚Äù‚ÄïJim Morrison

83582	Fear	83582.jpg	Due to some experimenting I‚Äôm totally afraid that I‚Äôll never like D in V sex. Like I‚Äôve never even been in that situation with a man before but like?idk. I am extremely enticed by the idea of giving head and I would love to make out with my man but like?idk. I‚Äôm just scared when I get in a relationship (and then married) it‚Äôll hurt to much or won‚Äôt feel good and I‚Äôll have to quit before our sex life even begins. And like sex is an important part of a healthy marriage. I know my fear is kind of irrational but also it‚Äôs a fear of mine	
83590	Fear	83590.jpg	This morning‚Äôs writing challenge has been brought to you by a slow sunrise and a hot cup of ginger tea. Today, we dove deep into our fears‚Äìand then exposed Fear itself as our greatest inner detractor. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not good enough to,?‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I can,?‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure if,‚Äù‚Äìall lies told by Fear. Today we looked our fears in the face and called them out for what they are: lies. I am so afraid that I am not a ‚Äúreal writer‚Äù‚Äìthat this has all been a gigantic fluke, and at any moment, whatever luck I‚Äôve had in writing poems will disappear one day, and I‚Äôll never be able to write another one. And yet‚Ä¶I‚Äôve been writing poems since I was six years old. I‚Äôve taken classes and workshops galore. I wake up in the middle of the night just to scribble down new lines on the daily. And in about a year, I will have published my first book of poems. Oh, Fear. You almost had me there. What are you afraid of? What lies has Fear told you?

83677	Fear	83677.jpg	The Beatles‚†Ä .‚†Ä There are two basic motivating forces: fear and love. When we are afraid, we pull back from life. When we are in love, we open to all that life has to offer with passion, excitement, and acceptance. We need to learn to love ourselves first, in all our glory and our imperfections. If we cannot love ourselves, we cannot fully open to our ability to love others or our potential to create. Evolution and all hopes for a better world rest in the fearlessness and open-hearted vision of people who embrace life. .‚†Ä ?John Lennon‚†Ä .‚†Ä .‚†Ä (at Candies)

83981	Fear	83981.jpg	It‚Äôs taken me a long time to be aware of how fear has played a staring role in my life. Tearing everything down and apart has been difficult and sorrowful work sometimes, but the reward has always been worth it. Accept that fear has a place in your life. It makes us very aware of a desire for something we do not have. And quickly it keeps us in line. It‚Äôs a gift and a curse. Get to know yours, understand its role, accept its desire for you to be safe, not to suffer, thank it as an indicator that you‚Äôre very much alive. Know when it prevents you from healing, growth, and expanding in an effort to feed itself.

Even though on my DASS tests it came up with anxiety along with my clinical depression I never thought of myself as someone with anxiety. My anxiety doesn‚Äôt stop me from doing thing like it does other people. I have almost panic attacks and can‚Äôt breathe but I still do the things that freak me out. And even though this workshop isn‚Äôt about my writing it‚Äôs still the first step to possibly getting published one day. Not to mention I‚Äôm going on my own to a capital city. Which I love doing that but it scares me also. But I have this in my head to keep me going. Bring on the writers workshop!

84262	Fear	84262.jpg	I reblogged this picture yesterday. This week I‚Äôve been going through another round of depression as I so often do. But this time all I could do was just sleep and when I would wake I would be so sad to the point I needed to vomit. My bf and I started a new social media platform and while I am super ecstatic to start a new journey to place a giant footprint in the tech world for a black women, it‚Äôs been super discouraging and stressful as well. People who you thought would support you, don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs cool for a couple folks, but damn all of them don‚Äôt support?even though I‚Äôm making this app for them. Hmmm Anyways, so that‚Äôs been a major factor in my depression this week, feeling like a failure, like I‚Äôd never get out this hole in my life, like I‚Äôll never amount to anything, no matter how much I put in. It sucks. Then I saw this picture. I stared at it for the longest time with tears streaming from my eyes. This felt like the light at the end of the tunnel, like you‚Äôre almost there. That‚Äôs when it hit me?a voice from inside as I stared deeper into the photo. ‚ÄúThis is your window of opportunity. You see how close you are? Don‚Äôt just look at it, go THROUGH it!? I began to ugly cry with my eyes still locked on and I whispered ‚ÄúI will? Just wanted to share this little glimmer of encouragement for anyone who is also feeling lost or hopeless. Find your window and go through it. We can do this. If you ever need to talk, my asks are wide open. I‚Äôm here.

84320	Fear	84320.jpg	It does not matter if fear is based on something bad that did happen. If that is the case, then fear becomes the fantasy that it could happen again, and it could. Any bad thing might happen at any moment in time. Bad things do happen to everyone. Some people have really bad things happen to them. Some people have bad things happen to them many times, but if everyone let fear determine their choices, very little would get accomplished in the world. The good news is that most people are mostly safe, most of the time in most places and situations. Some people may live in places that are less safe than others, and have to be more cautious than the average person, but even then, bad things don‚Äôt happen most of the time, and reasonable caution is not the same as fear. There are two keys to getting out of fear. The first key is get your mind on something else, and introduce logic into the fear. Identify counter arguments to the fear in your own thinking, and focus on those instead. The second key is walk through the fear. Do that which you fear, and the fear will begin to subside. If you run, fear will chase you. If you hide, fear will stalk you. The way out of fear is through it. No fear was ever conquered by avoidance. The good news is that the only power fear has over us is illusion. Challenge an illusion and you see it for what it is. Like the Great and Powerful Oz at the end of ‚ÄúThe Wizard of Oz? fear is just a timid little man behind a screen of illusion.	
84326	Fear	84326.jpg	Makes you wonder‚Ä¶how much control do we have over our lives‚Ä¶Given I am in the field of ‚Äúprophecy,?I believe we have opportunities, encounters and choices that lay ahead. However, fear, the ego and other people‚Äôs influence on our choices can often alter the paths we take. The important aspect to all of this is that there are lessons to learn at every turn. So almost always you never make the wrong choice! You just choose a different set of lessons to learn at a given time. If you do not actually learn from the experience mark my word it will come up again. Yet perhaps with a different cast of characters. (at Bushwick Junction)

Yet it is exactly what we must do to be truly free. We hold the key to the we so desperately seek. I‚Äôve spent a lot of my life hiding what I felt I could never share, & all that got me was more & Recently I chose to speak that which I felt could not be spoken & in doing so I was set Today I‚Äôm nervous of what is to come. I‚Äôm letting go of a story of who I was & have no idea of who I‚Äôm to become. It also excites me. I‚Äôm leaning into the unknown & trusting my process more than ever before, am more in with my & the more I learn the less I need to know. This is my truth to be spoken today & you my love?

84680	Fear	84680.jpg	Everything And Nothing by FreeByNature Indecisive. Moody. It‚Äôs complicated. Sometimes even when it feels like you have so much, you feel empty. Sometimes you want to create but you‚Äôre afraid to try, afraid to fail. You love the praise. Is that a bad thing? If we got no praise, would we still create? Do we really love it as much as we think we do? You love the praise. But how do you follow a previous success? You don‚Äôt even have any idea what you want to do. That spark, that inspiration, just can‚Äôt be forced. It comes and goes as it pleases. We‚Äôre supposed to practice everyday. But some days the motivation isn‚Äôt there. The idea isn‚Äôt there. But fear is there. Reluctance is there. Every new work is a new challenge. Not everybody enjoys charging into a new challenge, like adrenaline junkies. Not everyone is so thrilled to work, and that‚Äôs not even considering the reality of having to compete with others. But that‚Äôs not just art. That‚Äôs life in general. It‚Äôs scary. It makes you want to cry sometimes; why can‚Äôt it just be easier? So many of us love the reward, but dread the work that we have to do to be rewarded. It‚Äôs scary sometimes. There is however an encouraging saying that goes something like this: ‚ÄúIf you try to be 100% better every day, you‚Äôll fail by the end of the year. If you try to be 1% better every day, you‚Äôll be better by the end of the year. Have patience. Take small steps. Give it time.?~ bmviiofyva

Completely opposite. ~ It is not that you don‚Äôt have enough time to do anything, so you better do what your heart tells you to do. ~ But maybe it is that for love, time does not exist. For instance, any decision you want to make and time is a big factor in it. This proves that it is either not love or that fear is distorting it. ~ Love is timeless you see. You are timeless, have fun, enjoy this material existence, instead of fearing that it would not last. Love is timeless my friend. ~Tales of an over thinker Www.tripute.coach	
84882	Fear	84882.jpg	‚ÄúThe rule for all terrors is: head straight into them. When you are sailing in a storm, you don‚Äôt let a wave hit your boat on the side. You go bow into the wave, and ride it. So, in the same way, old folklore says: ‚ÄòWhenever you meet a ghost, don‚Äôt run away, because the ghost will capture the substance of your fear, and materialize itself out of your own substance?and will kill you eventually because it will take over all of your own vitality.?So then, whenever confronted with a ghost, walk straight into it, and it will disappear. In the some way, when people stir up the depths of the unconscious and are confronted with their own monsters, or with the terrors of discovering that they‚Äôre in a relativistic world where black implies white and white implies black?so who is in charge? ?You know, grandfather‚Äôs dead, father is too?just leaves me?'Oooohh, who‚Äôs the authority??See? When you get that sense of terror, go right at it. Don‚Äôt run away. Explore. Feel fear as completely as you can feel it. Head straight into it. And it so happens that these things give you the property?the opportunity?to go into some of your most closely kept skeletons."

84925	Fear	84925.jpg	I didn‚Äôt write The Mind Workout for a specific mental illness label or symptom because it doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre reacting to fear, or cravings, or voices, or jealousy, or horrifying intrusive thoughts or whatever it is that your brain happens to throw at you ?if that stuff is taking control of your life, it‚Äôs only natural to struggle with your mental health. That‚Äôs why so much of learning how to take care of your mental health and prevent mental illness is about learning how to be yourself while experiencing whatever you‚Äôre experiencing inside or outside of your head. And that‚Äôs something we can all work on. - Mark

84992	Fear	84992.jpg	of I was listening to a podcast today where someone pointed out how what really prevents us from pursing things is the hesitation and silence that occurs after we have an idea or desire to do something. We hesitate and all of these fears flood in and cripple us. So what if we didn‚Äôt hesitate but trained ourselves to take chances and act, how many things could we accomplish? How many more experiences would we have?

For the second time after the mounting populist wave is finding coherent and reasonable answers in a leader that is the expression of traditional leftist values rather than improbable characters leveraging on and The victory of would be our first step into our future. Measures like unconditional are simply inevitable in the next 30 years as human jobs rapidly disappear or a devalued due to and automation. Our current financial capitalist system will collapse because it only serves the wealthiest 1%. Capitalism can only be justified by a strong middle class, which is vanishing instead. Yes, neither nor have basic income in their programs but it‚Äôs understandable, they are sons of their time. The leaders that will deliver basic income are probably teenagers today. Still, old and honest leaders like them who are led by solid humanitarian values and genuinely work in people‚Äôs interest are crucial examples to have. Without them, the battle for power would be between puppets of the establishment and angry populists without values that leverage on hate and fear. Neither of them work in people‚Äôs interest. Don‚Äôt let make your vote be influenced by fear. Choose Hope.

85473	Happy	85473.jpg	La fine di un amore fa male, ma si guarisce. Si, la fine di un amore pu√≤ essere molto dolorosa, fa male, ma si guarisce. Tutto passa? Ricordo ancora la fine della mia prima vera storia d‚Äôamore. Piangevo come se non ci fosse un domani. Pensavo che non avrei mai pi√π trovato una persona simile. Pensavo che non avrei mai pi√π potuto amare di nuovo. Ero giunto alla conclusione che l‚Äôamore servisse solo a causare dolore. Forse una nuova relazione poteva dare un nuovo significato all‚Äôamore. E non doveva essere lo stesso che avevo gi√† sperimentato. Volevo un amore pi√π maturo, pi√π consapevole, forse pi√π cauto, ma pi√π profondo del primo. Amavo ancora quella donna, ma continuare significava continuare ad accontentarmi delle briciole che ricevevo. Non mantenne la sua promessa mi tradiva, tradiva l‚Äôuomo che nei momenti bui ha acceso la sua luce. Promisi allora a me stesso di non cercarla di pi√π. Quella volta imparai che a volte, per il nostro bene, dobbiamo lasciar andare anche chi amiamo. √à necessario per il nostro amor proprio e per la nostra dignit√†. Come mi sentivo? Come qualcuno che si lancia senza paracadute in certi giorni. In altri mi sembrava di vivere un lungo Autunno. Un Autunno senza promesse di primavera. Da allora, non resto nemmeno per un secondo in relazioni complicate, in braccia che non mi accolgono. Ho vissuto poi qualche amore leggero, di quelli che graffiano soltanto il cuore. Quelli che vedi finire senza troppi drammi, senza rimpianti. Senza tutto quel dolore. C‚Äô?voluto del tempo affinch√© le ferite del primo amore della mia vita guarisse. Ma sono guarito. Sono cresciuto, sono diventato una persona pi√π forte, pi√π consapevole e pi√π saggia. Oggi so cosa voglio e cosa non voglio. Cosa cerco in una storia, cosa posso sopportare e a cosa rinunciare. So che non voglio pi√π accontentarmi, so che ho ancora molto amore da dare. So che sono pronto per amare ancora e so che sar√† diverso da tutte le altre volte. Tratto dal diario delle esperienze personali.

85538	Happy	85538.jpg	Day 8, Eat More FAT! It will make you fuller faster, more satisfied, better digestion, better Brain function‚Ä¶and so much more. Eat the WHOLE AVOCADO, eat the YOLK, use full fat creamer, butter, yogurt, cottage cheese‚Ä¶CHEESE! ** Kick the low fat, no fat, chemical shit storm to the curb! I know, you‚Äôre thinking I‚Äôve just lost my mind! ü§™ü§™ I assure you‚Ä¶I have not! I started paying attention, learning more & really taking notice of the health trends of then & now. Our great grandparents were living Long lives without the knowledge of calories, fitbits, macros or micro nutrients. I believe it‚Äôs not a coincidence, the obesity epidemic began when No fat low fat products hit the shelves! Our bodies CANNOT produce FAT, it can store it but it does not Make fat, therefore we need to consume FAT. But someone somewhere said FAT, was the biggest culprit in heart disease & the vain obsession to be Skinny over healthy, Manufactures listened up! They cut the fat, but had to replace it with something‚Ä¶most often fillers (chemicals, gluten) & sugar. So, while the caloric intake seemingly decreased, it wasn‚Äôt better for our bodies! The body recognized it wasn‚Äôt being fed fat on a regular basis, therefore it stores whatever you feed it‚Ä¶it has to maintain a certain amount of Fat. Now‚Ä¶don‚Äôt go stupid. You know, Im not talking about Fried foods or mega amounts of Bacon! We are actually attempting to balance our Omega 3 vs Omega 6 I do suggest more oils (olive, coconut, avocado, sesame oils) **the source & quality of your Dairy is essential! Organic, Grass finished beef/dairy or goat. Block cheese (shred or sliced yourself‚Ä¶to avoid the chemical/product used to keep the cheese from sticking) If you have a dairy sensitivity, you will need to get fat from seeds nuts & oils. I didn‚Äôt always eat this way. I didn‚Äôt always understand My body or the way it works. I‚Äôve spent the last year studying Me & adjusting my diet! I can go on and on, and I will share more about me & this journey, But I recommend, you take your own journey Bit.ly/dietwithme

86230	Happy	86230.jpg	That‚Äôs the first! First post! And is about food because at 50?food is one of the not so many joys left!:) Just kidding! I am giving you a simple recipe for a soul bite! Potato and mushroom stew! Chop up 2 medium onions, one carrot and some celery(half cup or less). Let them get soft in a pot with a spoon of vegetable oil. Add 2-3 cups of hot chicken stock, one bay leaf, half teaspoon of black pepper, finely diced fresh rosemary, a teaspoon of sweet paprika and 5-6 medium/small potatoes sliced into medium chunks. When the potatoes are almost done, add 1 handful of diced colour pepper bells, 2 cups of chopped mushrooms, 2 diced fresh tomatoes, 3 diced garlic cloves, and 2 spoons of tomato light paste(passata di pomodoro). Let them simmer for 6-7 minutes, take the pot off the fire and add fresh chopped dill. Serve as warm as possible with a glass of Chablis or, if you like red wines, with a glass of Chianti. Makes you spin in the air!

It‚Äôs also unlike 2016 where I rode six flights. 2017 didn‚Äôt turn out to be a traveling year, but I counted hundreds of airplanes and felt happy where I am, wherever I was. Places of bestnine photos: first photo in NYC (2016), 3 photos at Manila, 2 photos at BGC, 2 photos at UPLB, 1 in Enchanted kingdom haha. My greatest achievement of 2017 was completing ¬æ of my internship (speech communication and writing) at DZJV and hearing my voice on air waaa. Thank you to the people who have been part of my 2017. I thank God for you!! Here‚Äôs to a brighter üòç More collabs and adventures and blessings üíï for 2018 charing üòÇüòÇüòÇ (at University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os)

89019	Happy	89019.jpg	This man right here just one day walked into my life called me chubby then made me the happiest person on earth without blinking twice. I never knew ones soul could be so full of good and pure intentions. Alex isn‚Äôt the type of person to do things with alternative motives. He‚Äôs not the kind of person that expects anything back. He never has double sided words. He never has double standards. He‚Äôs not fake. Everything he says or does for another person is genuine and pure. At first I thought it was naive. I‚Äôm not gonna lie I thought it was just him being too immature and not knowing how the real world was. The truth is he knows exactly the kind of pain and awful things the world has to offer and throws at you. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs so kind. That‚Äôs why he is so giving and nurturing. Alex is the change he wants to see. I always ask him why he‚Äôs so happy despite everything. He always just looks at me and says ‚ÄúWhy wouldn‚Äôt I be happy?? Before I met Alex I was full of revenge and hate. I wanted everyone that hurt me to hurt. Alex made me realize that it won‚Äôt make me feel better to hurt other people. It will make me feel better to save someone else from hurting the way I did. Alex has made me open my eyes to a world of possibilities that I never knew were there. And no I‚Äôm not talking about jobs or things or places but I‚Äôm talking about who I can be. I spent almost a year of my life trying to be someone who I didn‚Äôt really wanna be in order for someone to love me. I always thought that you just grew up and however you were was you. I never thought that I could choose who I was. I get to choose who I wanna be. It‚Äôs not easy. I have bad days, but each day I wake up he always reminds me to just be better than who I was yesterday. He‚Äôs helped me love myself despite everything I‚Äôve been taught to believe to be true about myself, and for that I‚Äôm eternally grateful. Even if years from now we aren‚Äôt together I can‚Äôt imagine having any bad feelings towards our relationship. There‚Äôs no games. No lies. No secrets. Just love, trust, honesty and commitment. Neither of us believe in ‚Äúsoulmates? We both think that there are many people out there that both of us could potentially love. What makes us special is that we not only love each other but we are partners in everything we do. Our connection runs so deep and it‚Äôs nothing I‚Äôve ever experienced before. We weren‚Äôt ‚Äúmeant to be together?per say. We chose each other to be life partners. I personally think that‚Äôs so much more special than the universe forcing us to be together or, ‚Äúmaking us for each other?I should say. We are two people from different places, completely different family‚Äôs and life experiences and we came together and realized that we make one hell of a team. We bring out the greatest versions of ourselves. We both still have sooo much to work on, don‚Äôt get me wrong. I‚Äôm too stubborn and he‚Äôs too proud most of the time but at the end of the day there isn‚Äôt anywhere else either of us would rather be than in each others arms.

89474	Happy	89474.jpg	from - üçÉ ANTARA HATI DAN TAKDIR üçÉ Jujur, Aku tidak paham kenapa perasaanku seperti ini, Resah gelisah karena terlalu sibuk memperhatikan gerak-gerikmu, Sungguh lelah menunggu kejujuranmu, Sebenarnya aku tidak mau berlarut dalam penantian dan pengharapan yang belum pasti. Jujur, Aku tak paham kenapa kamu begini, Seolah berkata tidak namun sebenarnya dirimu hanya berbohong kepada hatimu sendiri. Begitupun diriku ini. Cobalah mengalah, buang rasa gengsi, Aku tidak mau terjadi penyesalan, Jangan sampai semuanya terlambat. Jika hati ingin saling ditakdirkan, berusahalah. Berusaha untuk jujur. Jika aku diam saat ini, Bukan maksud hatiku untuk mengabaikanmu, Perlu untuk kamu tau, Aku tidak sedang berusaha menutup rasa itu, Tapi?Aku hanya membiarkan Allah menuntun hatiku menuju siapa yang pantas bagiku. Aku takut rasaku padamu hanya karena berharap, Aku takut hanya berharap kepada cinta yang salah, Hatiku tak yakin kalau kamu mulai biasa saja, Namun, semua mulai terasa bahwa kamu yang sempat pergi, seperti ingin kembali üò≠ Mungkin hatiku ini yang bersalah, Bersalah karena terlalu sibuk dengan dirimu, Tapi?aku mulai mengingat bahwa Allah sedang menguji iman kita, Allah sedang menguji keistiqomahan kita. Masih mampukah kita untuk saling menahan rasa itu? üò≠ Masihkah kita yakin akan janji-Nya bahwa Allah tau yang terbaik? üò≠ Ya robbana?jika memang kami pantas untuk bersatu, Kumohon?arahkanlah hati kami kepada-Mu selalu, Semoga?Dengan saling terpautnya hatiku dan hatinya hanya kepada-Mu, Engkau segera mentakdirkan kami menuju cinta yang halal. ?

90928	Happy	90928.jpg	Feliz Domingo!!! ‚ÄúRe√≠r, es arriesgarse a parecer un tonto. Llorar es arriesgarse a parecer un sentimental. Acercarse a otro ser es arriesgarse a comprometerse. Hacer algo por alguien, es arriesgarse a involucrarse. Expresar sentimientos, es arriesgarse a mostrar tu verdadero yo. Exponer tus ideas y tus sue√±os, es arriesgarse a perderlos. Amar, es arriesgarse a no ser correspondido. Vivir, es arriesgarse a morir. Desear, es arriesgarse a ser defraudado. Esperar, es arriesgarse a la desesperanza. Intentar, es arriesgarse a fallar? Autor Desconocido. Pero los riesgos deben ser tomados, porque el peligro m√°s grande en la vida es no arriesgar nada? La persona que no arriesga, no hace, nada tiene, nadie es. Tal vez se puedan evitar sufrimientos y preocupaciones, pero simplemente no se puede aprender, sentir, cambiar, crecer, amar ni vivir?Encadenado por las incertidumbres ser√°s un esclavo, sacrificar√°s el ser libre. Solo una persona que se arriesga es libre?Arri√©sgate; es cierto que puedes perder, pero?¬øHas pensado en lo que puedes ganar? Entonces, que sea un d√≠a para arriesgarte. ‚ú®Feliz y Bendecido D√≠a‚ú®üôèüèºüôåüèº‚ú® üì∑: Geoff (en Madrid, Spain)

92181	Happy	92181.jpg	Honesty hour guys. I‚Äôve been having a really rough time lately. Depression sneaks back every now and again. And stress has been eating me alive. I started working two jobs and I end up working all day everyday and go home exhausted. I don‚Äôt have time to write or draw and I try my best to make time for my friends and family. Well this last weekend my friends took me up to their cabin in New Mexico and I had the best weekend of my life. I‚Äôve missed the mountains so much and our days were spent exploring trails and seeing some really cool animals. This thanksgiving I just want to remind everyone that even when you want to give up you‚Äôve always got someone that cares about you and has your back. Thank you to my best friends Amy, Chase, and Domingo. I don‚Äôt know what I would do without you guys.	
92193	Happy	92193.jpg	üîÆ‚ú®üíïDaily reading for Thursday November 23rd 2017. This reading is meant for everyone who sees this post. üå∏ Nine of Cups üå∏ -Wishes fulfilled, comfort, happiness, satisfaction. the Nine of Cups reflects happiness in all areas such as health, finances, work, luck, love or relationships. After the difficult choices of the Seven and the stagnation of the Eight, the Cups suit starts to balance out with the Nine. One of the most positive and uplifting cards of the entire deck, the Nine of Cups shows satisfaction on all levels ?emotional, physical, and sensual. It is no wonder that many Tarot readers refer to this card as the Wish Card as its appearance is often taken as a sign that, whatever your heart‚Äôs desire, it shall be granted in the coming days or weeks. Know that you have paved our own way on the path to success. As a Cups card, the Nine usually refers to an emotionally fulfilling situation, such as the strengthening of a romantic bond, the solidification of a friendship or the consummation of a sexual relationship. It shows that joy and happiness are within your grasp. In fact, you probably already have them. It is a sign to enjoy the abundance of life and to feel each of your emotions as if you had never felt any of them before. See the perfection all around you. The Nine of Cups is also about counting your blessings, living in the moment, and enjoying the good things that life has to offer. Start or end every day by creating a mental list of the three things you are most grateful for. You will find that over time, you indeed have a lot to be happy about and it may increase your feeling of deep contentment and fulfilment. üå∏üçÉüåºüçÉüå∏üçÉüåºüçÉüå∏üçÉüåºüçÉüå∏üçÉüåºüçÉüå∏ üíåüóù If you would like a more in depth message about your personal situation, please visit my website www.MoonLightMiracle.com and click on the ‚ÄúTarot Readings?tab in the menu bar.

But instead, I am learning that I can control my attitude and how I deal with it. There is nothing more liberating than learning to let go of what you cannot change or control.

The feathers of the arrow (the ones on top of the arrow being right side up and the ones below being upside down) form a symbol that means I am worth more than too high or too low. I am worth more than too high or too low. My whole life, I have allowed numbers to determine my self worth. The number on the scale, the number of calories eaten in a day, the number of miles run in a week, my race times, my team ranking, my test scores, the number of friends I had, the number of boy that liked me, the number of people that said hi to me in the hall?I allowed all of these things to determine my self worth. It has been a long, hard journey, and it is by no means over. I will have to fight the voices in my head that tell me I‚Äôm not good enough and try to reduce me to a number my whole life. But now I am strong enough to fight them. I am more than my weight. I am more than my race times. I am more than the number of friends I have. I am more than a number that is too high or too low. I am me, and for the first time in such a long time, I am so proud of that.

93581	Happy	93581.jpg	Heck, it‚Äôs been almost a month since the last post. Hahaha. But I‚Äôve been very productive the past days. I have done a lot of things and I‚Äôve been of what I am achieving. Busy can be a word to describe it but I prefer to call it productive cos they are actually what I need to be doing, since I also consider now social media as a distraction to me, lol. If I‚Äôm not on social media, I‚Äôm not busy. I‚Äôm productive. Hahahaha!! Kidding. (Hey, I‚Äôm not saying social media is bad. It is actually good! It‚Äôs just that in this time of my life, I have more responsibilities to do) Anyways, it‚Äôs been a year since the last YSA Conference (cos we usually do it end of October). I actually looked back on my post and last year, I have no one to dance with. But now, well, it‚Äôs the best YSA Conference that I have attended. Nandun kasi siya. Hahaha! Nakakatawang pakinggan pero honestly, I am happy. Yep, I am happy. :) During the dance social night, the song ‚ÄúCan I Have This Dance?was played. I had previously told my during one of our dates if she can imagine me and her with this And that night, it happened. I told her to look me in the eyes while dancing and never doubt that I her. Also, when the host said that it‚Äôs time to change partners, we didn‚Äôt. Well? I didn‚Äôt. Bahala kayo. Hahaha. I finished the whole song with her. It was also our first dance as a :) The activity lasted only for 2 days and a night, and I am with her most of the times. Palagi kaming magkasama. Well in fact, I was the one who‚Äôs wanting to be with her most of the times, but I also make sure na hindi ako masyadong yung binabawalan siya. I want to be with her cos I just want her to feel that I am just there. :) Alam ko din naman na mahal niya ako. Hehehe. She would choose to be with me rather than her friends. And cos that‚Äôs the case, I promise that I would be the best friend she will ever have. Lust has no part in our I know that our relationship is pure, and I love it. And oh! We both had a study as a couple the morning on the 2nd day. It was neat. :) All of the pictures are during the social night. :)

94549	Happy	94549.jpg	Today. Today I had to pull my car over before my head exploded in LA traffic. I had to hit the pause button before I went any further. Realizing I‚Äôm in another transitional phase of life, career, relationships. Looking in the mirror at my reflection, asking myself, what‚Äôs really important? Acknowledging I have my health, an amazing family, supportive friends, roof over my head, I‚Äôm blessed. Yet, there‚Äôs still this piece missing. The piece where the struggle to maintain a career just teaching yoga hits me in the face. Realizing it‚Äôs time, once again, to reprioritize. It‚Äôs been almost 3 years since I packed up my corporate suit and went straight into the studios teaching, doing what I love, and I‚Äôd never go back to change that. Never. Some days are harder than others. Today is one of those days. Where I‚Äôm unbalanced. I‚Äôm not centered, not grounded. But this is me. The best medicine for this? I‚Äôm taking my own advice. Heading to a class and getting on my mat. Anyone else ever feel the challenge of sacrifice for choosing to do what you love? Oh, and thanks to my Manma for being such a great ear üëÇ today. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without you. (at Los Angeles, California)

98277	Happy	98277.jpg	Boring post but hey ho! So, I normally used to knock back about a litre of water a day which is great, but then I became addicted to it in a good way obviously! Pushing almost 4 litres a day now, I feel better for it too & I‚Äôve lost a few pounds without trying. Mix that water intake with exercise & I‚Äôll be getting in a better shape which I won‚Äôt lie, excites me. All about being happy & confident right?

98430	Happy	98430.jpg	From my private class for group in Kebayoran, South Jakarta. This is Dhanurasana or Bow Pose. Benefit: This pose is good for stretching your shoulders, chest, legs and ALL! The stretch can make you feel a little bit sleepy, because your body is happy and satisfied after the stretch. Instructions: - Lay down on your chest, - Bend your knees, - Grab your ankles with your hands, - Lift your chest, hands and legs, - Stay in the pose for 5 to 10 breaths. For further info on my private yoga class, you can contact me at my email: astrid_amalia @ yahoo dot com. (at Kebayoran Lama, Jak-sel)

98639	Happy	98639.jpg	24/09/2017 Today was a good day. One of those days where you wake up feeling refreshed and happy to start the day. Where the stress that hangs over you floats away like the clouds after a rainy day. Yes, today was good. I didn‚Äôt feel bad about spending money. I didn‚Äôt feel bad about not doing any work. But best of all, I didn‚Äôt feel bad about myself. I know I should have been more productive, but I wanted to enjoy this feeling while it lasts. The sunshine never lasts forever, so I guess i should start preparing for the storm to roll back in and stay for a while. Like it never left. Picture: The Oxbow - Thomas Cole

I am so so so incredibly happy and you have no idea how excited I am to sprawl out on a bed, and an absolutely gigantic one at that. None of this could have been possible without the help of my wonderful parents who took a day to drive 200 miles to me with a truck to transport furniture. I cannot express how incredibly grateful I am for their undying love and support and help. And the kitties like the new furniture too.

It‚Äôs such a meaningful tattoo to me, and I‚Äôm so proud of you, Jessica, for your incredible tattooing! She‚Äôs available to discuss tattoo appointment via her EMAIL button on her IG page.

105852	Happy	105852.jpg	True!! All to often on social media people are making nasty comments or hashtags on others pages belittling, and saying nasty things when all these people are doing is living a lifestyle they want to live and hoping that they are inspiring at least one person to live a healthy lifestyle too. If it‚Äôs not your passion or dreams to be healthy, fit, have muscle, be a little more lean, watch what you eat, count macros, weigh your food to get your portions right or just lose a little weight to feel better or to just be able to love yourself for who you are then that‚Äôs totally your choice and that‚Äôs perfectly fine?BUT It‚Äôs no ones right to make others feel like crap for doing what makes them feel good and happy! If you have nothing nice to say, then unfollow the ones your hurting and move on with your life and enjoy the things you love to do. I hope everyone has an amazing Wednesday! üòä thanks for sharing this !! (at Klamath Falls, Oregon)

107386	Happy	107386.jpg	Today‚Äôs daily reading for Thursday November 8th, 2018 speaks of confusion and dissatisfaction in unequal relationships. Notice the Knight of wands crowns the queen of wands here. This symbolizes that the knight who hasn‚Äôt met the rank of the Queen or a King, has been put on a pedestal. The Queen had better take her rightful place on the top and her happiness will increase! This symbolism reminds us not to place anyone or anything above our own needs, because doing so will only lead to confusion and unhappiness! Instead let‚Äôs put our own needs first‚Ä¶Our ultimate satisfaction depends on it! Today‚Äôs universal number is 11+8+2018= 12= 3. The number 3 represents Mother Earth‚Äôs nurturing energy, beauty, abundance, creativity and fertility. Usually when the number 3 comes up, Spirit reminds us to find emotional balance and grounding. Spirit once again advises we do just that. Once we find balance within via meditation, visualization and or intention, matters within our relationships will become more and more clear. If we remain in our heads and scatter brained, we will find ourselves once again confused and dissatisfied with an good dose of exhaustion! Find balance through a grounding meditation or spending quality time outdoors in Mother Nature. Your personal number for the reading is 7+9= 16= 7. The number 7 represents inner wisdom, angelic protection and divine guidance. Spirit urges us to go within today and get in touch with our true feelings and our inner guidance. If we don‚Äôt find complete clarity, that‚Äôs totally alright. Perhaps then we will receive the next indicates step. At the bare minimum, we will feel a lot more peaceful and calm. So let‚Äôs opt to take care of ourselves shall we?! Everything else can wait. Sending much love and many blessings.

108221	Happy	108221.jpg	Tip to Reclaim Your Power: Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDo I want to own my own upset and maintain self-control, or do I want to give my power away and blame others for taking it?? The choice is yours and the choice never goes away. You can draw on the power of self control at any moment. Make a list of things you‚Äôre grateful for- even if it‚Äôs something as simple as sitting there being able to make a list! Once you start writing you will gain momentum and start realizing more and more the things you have to be grateful for. Being bullied is often a multi-layered situation and no one should have to face these issues alone! Try confiding in a family member, friend, or counselor. With time, support, and practice seeing your own self worth you will not only get through it you will be able to reclaim your power and be stronger because of it! (at Bang Boxing)

110212	Happy	110212.jpg	In the practice of Yoga one can emphasize the body, the mind or the self and hence the effort can never be fruitless. True yoga is not about the shape of your body, but the shape of your life. Yoga is not to be performed; yoga is to be lived. Yoga doesn‚Äôt care about what you have been; yoga cares about the person you are becoming. Yoga is designed for a vast and profound purpose, and for it to be truly called yoga, its essence must be embodied. Have a Good and Healthy World Yoga Day!! üôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè En la pr√°ctica del Yoga uno puede enfatizar el cuerpo, la mente o el yo y por lo tanto el esfuerzo nunca puede ser infructuoso. El verdadero yoga no se trata de la forma de su cuerpo, sino la forma de su vida. El yoga no es para ser realizado; El yoga debe ser vivido. El yoga no le importa lo que ha sido; El yoga se preocupa por la persona que se est√° convirtiendo. El yoga est√° dise√±ado para un prop√≥sito vasto y profundo, y para que sea verdaderamente llamado yoga, su esencia debe ser encarnada. Que tengan un d√≠a bueno y sano feliz d√≠a del yoga internacional !! (at Machupicchu, Cusco, Peru)

117372	Happy	117372.jpg	New Post has been published on Watch Your Step What I love about this photo, is not the awesome focus that my camera caught, its the green that lies below in the water. I‚Äôve stated before that water is among the things that I find most amazing in the world. Lake water is no exception. There is so much life beyond what you can see on the surface, it is astounding. The thing that I love about this photo, is the color of the water. It‚Äôs green and m murky. This murkiness means that the body of water is pretty healthy, because all the nutrients in the water don‚Äôt allow the sun to get too deep. ?JM

The town itself is quite a little touristy town, and definitely a place worth visiting once in a while. I have a few photos yet to post of this beautiful location over the course of the next few weeks, and will definitely be re-visiting sometime in the very near future! Lake Michigan has several light houses that I hope to venture to over the course of this summer. What are some of your favorite light house locations and where?

118842	Happy	118842.jpg	Why is Happiness Important? 1Ô∏è‚É£The purpose of life. Being happy is one of the main purposes of life. 2Ô∏è‚É£Health. A positive outlook helps to boost our immune system and help us to protect ourselves against disease. Happiness equals elevated emotional and mental health, as well as physical health. 3Ô∏è‚É£Productivity. When we are enjoying our work, our productivity increases. 4Ô∏è‚É£Zero conflict. When we are happy we do not get into disputes and conflicts so readily. So, we have a good effect on others, too. 5Ô∏è‚É£A fulfilling life. When we are happy, we feel that our life is more satisfying and fulfilling. by LightHouse (at Kansas City, Missouri)

122015	Happy	122015.jpg	Hoy es d√≠a de y har√© una menci√≥n especial a la lectura. Recuerdo cuando le√≠ ?0 mil leguas de viaje submarino?de Verne. Tendr√≠a unos 10 a√±os y una infancia particular que me permiti√≥ crear mecanismos para aprender, ilusionarme o sencillamente vivir otras cosas. Leer es una experiencia maravillosa y hoy la practicidad tecnol√≥gica parece haberla reducido a lo m√≠nimo requerido. Cuando leemos ponemos a trabajar al m√°ximo nuestra imaginaci√≥n y nuestro esp√≠ritu termina nutrido de ideas, analog√≠as y mucha fantas√≠a. Hoy recuerdo un buen t√≠tulo porque ser√≠a para un ni√±o un excelente regalo en todo sentido, c√≥mo lo fue para m√≠ en su momento? (en Yaracuy)

Sara Gilbert, her co-star and an executive producer on the revival, condemned Barr‚Äôs statement, while writer Wanda Sykes said she was leaving the show.

122539	Happy	122539.jpg	Another late workout. And of course, it requires a little liquid gold energy drink with a few strawberries to make it a bit more, well, pretty. The family had cheeseburgers & corn on the cob, but I didn‚Äôt want anything that heavy for supper so I ate cod, veggies & a baked potato. Now that I got my workout out of the way, I get to sit down & have my daily nutritional shake & wait for the Yankees to come on. I may get my evening fasciablasting session in after a little while as I do need to work my calves, feet & my arms. But for now, I‚Äôm gonna enjoy this shake & read my PD. I strengthened my body today now my mind & my heart. If it‚Äôs at all possible to change your perception about your life, would you change it!? If you could do anything to be happy & healthy, wouldn‚Äôt you try everything!? I know my own happiness along with my health are priceless!! Do you feel the same!? I hope so. And if you‚Äôre ready, I‚Äôm waiting on ya, so go ahead & contact me for my next fit group. Registration has begun.

I have a few photos yet to post of this beautiful location over the course of the next few weeks, and will definitely be re-visiting sometime in the very near future!

123596	Happy	123596.jpg	May 2010 vs May 2018.. It‚Äôs been a crazy 8 years, never thought I‚Äôd be where I am now. Sorry I‚Äôve not been posting much on this account, but to be honest it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve not really got much to say now! There‚Äôs not a whole lot going on transition wise, I think I‚Äôve actually got to the stage where it‚Äôs no longer an active part of my day to day life. I moved to Brighton about 5 months ago, love this place so much, have a great group of friends, an incredible girlfriend, a decent job and I‚Äôm actually busy alot, just going out and about exploring or socialising. I‚Äôm feeling pretty happy and content at the moment, I think more so than I ever have, so I guess that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve not been overly active in the online world. But I‚Äôm still here, I‚Äôll post now and then, and certainly update if anything happens transition wise and any milestones etc. I hope everyone is doing well!

126208	Happy	126208.jpg	I always think of what it would be like if there was a place where everyone won. Where everyone was equal. Everyone was happy. But then there would be no hard work towards change. No strive. No need to make yourself better. If you get exactly what you want and there‚Äôs nothing to work towards making better than there is no change in anything at all. There is no life changing moment. its bland. its boring. you know exactly what will happen next. Taarradhin isn‚Äôt that everyone and everything is perfect. It means everyone wins in the end. No matter what you‚Äôre going through, everyone will make it out a winner. Life gets hard but you will win. We all will win

130398	Happy	130398.jpg	[The Comfort Zone] by; Anonymous I used to have a comfort zone where I knew I couldn‚Äôt fail, The same four walls of busy work were really more like a jail I longed so much to do the things I‚Äôd never done before, But I stayed inside my comfort zone and paced the same old floor I said it didn‚Äôt matter that I wasn‚Äôt doing much, I said I didn‚Äôt care for things like diamonds or furs and such I claimed to be so busy with the things inside my zone, But deep inside I longed for something special of my own I couldn‚Äôt let my life go by just watching others win, I held my breath and stepped outside to let the change begin I took a step and with new strength I‚Äôd never felt before, I kissed my comfort zone good bye and closed and locked the door If you are in a comfort zone afraid to venture out, Remember that all winners were at one time filled with doubt A step or two and words of praise can make your dreams come true Greet your future with a smile, success is there for you!

132960	Happy	132960.jpg	üåô {scroll to see all pictures} anyway, the second photo means a lot to me, for multiple reasons. photoshop..it‚Äôs a beautiful & disastrous thing. we see all of these models, both male and female. you know the ones i‚Äôm talking about, the ones all over Instagram, facebook, snapchat, magazines, etc. yes, photoshop can do some great things, especially funny. but it also hurts us in a way. we all look at these models and think ‚Äòthat‚Äôs what i should look like? ‚Äòthat‚Äôs what society wants? ‚Äòif I don‚Äôt look like that i‚Äôm not enough and no one will ever have me? And coming from someone who used to think all of that, let me tell you, you‚Äôre wrong. you. do. not. need. social. approval. you are beautiful, special, & magnificent in your own way!!! don‚Äôt let people tell you, don‚Äôt let magazines or photoshop, tell you/make you feel like you aren‚Äôt good enough. there is no standard. every single person is beautiful. someone doesn‚Äôt like you? someone doesn‚Äôt like your appearance? okay, that‚Äôs their loss. it all starts with loving yourself & being happy. I believe in you.üíó the pictures i posted, are me. no filters. no photoshop. no anything. no one truly needs photoshop of filters. we‚Äôre who we are and how we are for a reason. don‚Äôt let society & others knock you down. you have to be confident & positive, that‚Äôs key.üíó? ps..don‚Äôt be afraid to take goofy selfies. or selfies in general. sure, filters and makeup are fun, but you don‚Äôt need them because you are beautiful in your own way.

As stated on campaign, ‚ÄúToday we start a journey together that we sure weren‚Äôt looking forward to. My baby girl has been diagnosed with Rhabdomyosarcoma. It‚Äôs a form of cancer that appears on the muscle tissue. Unfortunately hers is in the lower intestine so they‚Äôll have to remove a small portion of it. Today and tomorrow we‚Äôre here to get some lab work done before her surgery next week. It‚Äôs been a roller coaster of emotions to say the least so I‚Äôm asking all my family and friends for your prayers during these challenging times.

But then there‚Äôs many people who say they don‚Äôt care of others opinions, yet secretly are fixated on actually worried about others opinion. This viscous cycle does feel like a mental prison. Be true to yourself. The people that accept you for you will stick around. Don‚Äôt change to be accepted. Change for your own acceptance within. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä

134785	Happy	134785.jpg	Maritza shares, ‚ÄúI apologize for the very long post, when I lost my sister in 2005, I became depressed, shut down and completely turned to food. It became like a comfort for me and because of that it became an addiction. I ate when I was happy, mad, sad or snack because food was there! When I see old pictures it is unreal how heavy I become, I was between 370-380! I knew I needed to do something but gave up when I tried everything that is out there and nothing worked!! I was on the verge of diabetes which runs on my mom‚Äôs side, no energy, and definitely didn‚Äôt want to be in pictures! But in July 2014 all that changed when I was introduced to Saba by my great friend Michele Riddle, she told me about the Saba 60 program. I am so thankful that she cared enough to share Saba with me! I have lost 180 pounds and additional 10 more with our Empower Smart Coffee which helped me get over my plateau, total of 190 pounds gone forever!! I still have a way to go, but I know I will get there. I‚Äôm not trying to get skinny, just be a healthier me!!?

135131	Happy	135131.jpg	Day16 Do not feed the Fears! Write down whatever you‚Äôre afraid of‚Ä¶Write it down. Then laugh at it! Embrace that fear, let those butterflies propel you into action. Time isn‚Äôt wasted in the pursuit of your future success. Look forward to feeling that feeling‚Ä¶Find something you fear, do that, Do more of that. If you can‚Äôt do it daily, do it weekly. You may have tried in the past. It may not have gone well, quit living on the past, Learn from it! Many people fear being to old, the timing isn‚Äôt right, the time has past?it‚Äôs never too late to pursue your dreams. Too much fear often leads to regret not failure. Bc if you‚Äôre too afraid to try you will never come close to failing. But you will meet Regret! Nobody wants to regret! So, embrace your fear! You will be stronger for it!

135578	Love	135578.jpg	If you pay attention and look closely at this episode, You can see that both the louds and cassagrande are both and have a strong force bond connection too each other in their powers whether they are close or distant miles by like they are strong as steel that no one in their families will be ever separated forevermore(All of them are amazingly connected Of what they are either doing or thinking, They all thought the same,Even their own opinions are the exact same sometimes).In my deductive fact conclusion,They we‚Äôre destined too be really reunited as yin and yang together(Both innate families have a variety of both creation and destruction too match their skills and capabilities together,That brings synchronization and more popularity of them at the series),And brings more ascension of the audience too foreshadowed at the end that no matter what happens, They will always end up together as a one big happy family.‚ò∫‚ò∫üòáüòáüòäüòäüò∫üò∫üí™üí™üëåüëå‚úä‚úäüëçüëç

135990	Love	135990.jpg	Pensavo, ultimamente penso troppo. Forse √® meglio dire viaggiavo .. Pensavo e viaggiando con la mente mi chiedevo se non fosse che nella realt√† ci tratteniamo troppo o se forse sono io che metto la fisicit√† in uno degli step principali di una conoscenza. B√® si, forse sbaglio io. Ed √® proprio questo che mi attira, la tua diversit√†, il tuo non essere come gli altri, il tuo essere pazzo, diverso. Il tuo essere emotivo, sentimentale, non romantico sia chiaro, ma emozionale. Metti davanti a tutto la teoria delle menti, cerchi compatibilit√† psicologiche, mentali, compatibilit√† di pensiero e poi, solo dopo, forse, ti lascerai andare alla superficialit√† dei nostri corpi. Hai centrato il segno e ci√≤ mi fa impazzire, mi fa impazzire come mi sei entrato in testa, per intelligenza e cultura e mi fa impazzire come mi sei entrato nell'anima per dolcezza, emotivit√† e sentimentalismo. √à raro, anzi praticamente impossibile trovare una persona che arriva e mette al primo posto la mente di una persona prima del corpo. Mi hai preso, hai centrato il bersaglio. Chiss√†, magari nemmeno lo volevi, chiss√†, magari ti stai chiedendo perch√© io mi stia facendo viaggioni assurdi. Chiss√†, magari le tue mani quando siamo insieme, non tremano solo per il freddo? (presso Milan, Italy)

140501	Love	140501.jpg	Each of us has our own measure of pain. Sometimes the pain we suffer is great and obvious; sometimes it is subtle. Our pain can reflect the coldness of our families, the trauma of our parents, the stultifying influence of much modern education and media, the difficulties of being a man or a woman. As a result, we often feel that we have been cast out. To survive we have to cover our heart, build up a layer of clay, and defend ourselves. We lose the belief that we are worthy of love. ?Jack Kornfield, From Self-Hate to Compassion

140883	Love	140883.jpg	This beautiful, photo of my maternal Eileen McGillivray and George Alexander ‚ÄúBud?McConnell, has always helped define what is and can be. The natural embrace, different but equally enamoured smiles, photographed in a very simple setting show how clearly they adored each other. While I don‚Äôt remember very much of my Grandpa since he passed on when I was very young, I do have memories of how kind and loving he was and his simple, but warm smiles when he looked at my Gramma. I also remember just how smitten she was when talking about him, how big her own smile was when he came into the kitchen in the mornings, when he arrived home from work, when they took trips, danced, watched us play, visited with family, and shared so many of life‚Äôs activities and adventures together. As with any relationship, I‚Äôm certain life wasn‚Äôt always easy for them‚Äîin many ways more challenging than we have it now‚Äîbut they made the best of its many gifts and stumbles and were always the strongest champions for each other. Even at our young age, their reciprocal affection and support was very apparent to all. Life isn‚Äôt always sunshine and roses and there‚Äôs uncountable challenges, chasms, and rocky paths as we move through time but it‚Äôs made immeasurably more navigable and enjoyable when we have a to share the journey with. I feel very blessed to have one of my own: ‚ù§Ô∏è

141190	Love	141190.jpg	Topic: Gratitude & Appreciation This weekend was a bit of a whirlwind. Sometimes my schedule meshed with the families and sometimes it didn‚Äôt. Yesterday, I was gone all day from 8:30am until nearly 8pm. I got home to these fresh flowers and a delicious bottle of Sangiovese. I think they missed me. Then again I guess the millions of hugs from the kids and the jumping and snuggles from the dog sort of gave that away. I was so happy I made it for bedtime. Small gestures go a long way. Often the small ones are the most impactful too. Love my family!

142137	Love	142137.jpg	27022019 vulnerable, lost and incomplete. * Unconditional love is not a concept. It is an immeasurable stream of energy that already exists. It is never withheld. It is not measured or deserved. It simply is ?we can tap into it, and propagate it, or not. To love unconditionally is a verb. We do love, we speak love, we be love. This is how we live love, and make it real. Be teachable when it comes to love. To love unconditionally will never reduce us or take anything from us. If we are diminished by it, we aren‚Äôt truly loving unconditionally. Something is attached. To love unconditionally only wears us into our pre-existing perfection. Love is revealing ?it makes us more of who and what we really are. Our true nature. Virgo is the reminder to get out of our own way. To move aside. To drop the conditioning. To exist amidst and in between lines.

142491	Love	142491.jpg	‚ñ™Ô∏èBlack History Month Day 14‚ñ™Ô∏è Prior to the Civil War, Black couples were allowed to live together and have some privileges of matrimony, but they were never legally married, or recognized as such by any white institution. The fear of separation was especially haunting for couples. Slaves faced the greatest threats of being sold away in their prime years, precisely when they would have been young couples. The trepidation loomed large over their relationships, which sometimes made them unsure about whether or not to wed. The threat of separation was used as a form of punishment and containment to keep slaves obedient. It also became an issue when the finances of the slave owners lagged or when they passed away and their estates had to be settled. Masters were quite blunt in making this clear even in the marital vows exchanged between slaves, ‚Äúuntil death or distance do you part.?That is part of the horror of slavery within American History that we must all confront. Many slaves, with the help of the Union Army and Northern missionaries, began the process to formalize their unions during the Civil War. Contraband camps were set up to house the runaways and to put them to work aiding the United States military. Northern missionaries and abolitionists seized the opportunity to use these sites to cultivate Christian norms and values associated with citizenship in a post-slavery world. They began the process of marrying slaves ‚Äúunder the flag,?that is, formalizing their relationships under the authority of the federal government. Thousands of former slaves were remarried or married for the first time in this context. After the war ended, the defeated Southern states were forced to pass laws during Reconstruction recognizing the marriages of former slaves. The Civil War opened the door to both chaos and unforeseen possibilities. It became an important turning point in the history of African American marriages.

142577	Love	142577.jpg	To the ‚ÄúMakers of Love? 9th Cloud Way Above us on Earth, 88888 Dear Sir/Madam, First of all, I‚Äôd like to say that I am a HUGE FAN of your product! I‚Äôve been using love since I was conceived and it rates with the top 3 things I cannot live without! I‚Äôve paid so much for it, that once I was left homeless for it. I‚Äôm such a fan of love, that I would pay it again to have it in my life! However, please, could you make the next batch with longer life? You see, the last bitch‚Ä¶sorry, the last batch I got, the packaging said it was good ‚Äòtil death?and it turned bitter before it disappeared in the end. Unless I‚Äôm already in hell (which may be), I‚Äôm still here and without it. I‚Äôm not upset at you, I‚Äôm sure it was the bad packaging. However, many of us down here agree that love needs a longer life in general. Other than that, the times I‚Äôve had it? OMG! It is the best thing EVER! Keep up a job oh! so we‚Äôll done!

142867	Love	142867.jpg	Once a heart has broken, it can never go back to what it was before. That is usually our first instinct: to make the present like the past. We think if we can just get back to the way things were, we‚Äôd be fine. When that doesn‚Äôt work, our next moves are often either to distract ourselves with something else or to numb ourselves. All of these attempts prolong our recovery and cause us to hide our wounds instead of healing them. We end up with secret scars that still bleed. So what is there to do? We must be careful because too much doing and we are just back to distracting ourselves. Begin by being present with your heart. Feel where in your body the pain resides and embody that space fully. Don‚Äôt be squeamish about it. Experience the ache. If it makes you cry, then cry. But don‚Äôt let your mind tune into those feelings and start drawing conclusions. Stay with the heart. That is the practice of the broken-hearted. Don‚Äôt run, don‚Äôt avoid, don‚Äôt try to suture it back together. Let it throb, let it burn, let it wake you up. This wound becomes a special gift, a way to relate and feel love for others. If we allow ourselves to be open and vulnerable, life will break our hearts more than once. But if you realize your heart is being broken *open* and that you are being awakened from within, you can stay with it and let it grow you. Like a caterpillar in a chrysalis, there is no way to know where this will lead you. And just as the caterpillar couldn‚Äôt have imagined nor predicted wings, you can‚Äôt know what metamorphosis to expect. But there is no sane alternative. Let it happen.

142919	Love	142919.jpg	Once we realize the extent to which both our ‚úîÔ∏èsubtle and grand choices (of love over fear) shape our life, draw the types of good others toward us, plus determine what and how we manifest‚Ä¶we üí• see more and more clearly that a state of LOVE is the only way of Being that we ever want to embody. Tied together are: (1) a low/no ego nature of üïâ authenticity, (2) a sense of connectedness to others [beings & creatures], (3) a sincere understanding that our üóù intentions and state of consciousness do create our reality, + (4) awareness of the wisdom of releasing üéàlow vibe fear reactions (replaced instead by high vibe loving responses of: kindness, patience, hope compassion, possibility, etc.) - we then paint a bright and brilliant canvas for our life. üí´ The choice is truly up to each of us. As we embrace a consistent meditative chakra üåÄenergy balancing practice (daily), we tune-in to: (1) our soul consciousness, (2) the wisdom of intuition [Higher Guidance], and (3) see more clearly how our ‚òØÔ∏èreactions, responses, and decision are shaping our life‚Äôs landscape. In simplicity, all comes down to üå± love, rather than fear. Moving through ingrained habits and inherited/learned programs of everyday life, it often takes a bit more time and deliberate focus to see the subtle ways in which fear can undermine. So, through tuning-in to silent reflection & awareness during practice, we quiet the noise of our life chaos & hectic pace. We see & hear & understand. In love, üíöwe grow. Which practices are we flowing through today & this week in order to: tune-in, elevate, expand, and fill life with more high vibe love? ?

Sliding scale: $30-$50 for two hours of tangible take-aways and methods for restoring your joints and healing chronic back/neck pain, knee pain, wrist/hand/foot dysfunction, even headaches or any other ailments you may have. My approach is holistic through and through and can help you with issues that are seemingly unrelated to the movement of your body. This is because EVERYTHING in our bodies is intricately intertwined, even despite our efforts to separate the systems of the body to different medical professions (doctors are GREAT don‚Äôt get me wrong), but WHAT IF there was a way to bring it all together and address our bodies as one SINGULAR system, made up of co-dependent, individual parts?

It is this same love that pours out of God‚Äôs own being and brings us here, that sustains us here, that will take us back home. It is this same love that we recognize in other people, who love their babies and their community as we love our babies and our community. When we recognize this same love in one another, we will not stand for having something happen to other people‚Äôs babies and community that we wouldn‚Äôt want to have happen to ours.

143273	Love	143273.jpg	wrote these words for our hook pull today: ‚ÄúA waning crescent moon is up in the east before sunrise. It‚Äôs waning toward the new moon when the moon will be between the Earth and the sun. Astronomers call this an old moon.? I don‚Äôt know what this means to Domina or anyone else. There were well qualified energy workers and witches at the beach who could comment on the nuances of these statements. That‚Äôs not me. I will say this about the moon. I know it has a magnetic effect on the ocean and the rise and fall of the tides. I know there is a connection between menstruation and the lunar cycle. In Greek tragedy catharsis was related to menses or purification. To me, Domina‚Äôs words about the moon are a story of cathartic purification. To bleed. To release any fear for the future, and in letting go be present with the rise and fall of the tides of experience. Which is what we did. As a family. The women took hooks. Stood in the ocean. Then pulled. Slow. Steady. Hard.

Showing me that I can make through with a little help from my friends. You‚Äôve become like a sister to me. You encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone when you asked if I wanted to go to HennaCon. I was hesitant at first, but, everything just fell into place, and that‚Äôs when I knew that was meant to be. You have such a beautiful spirit, that inspires everyone in your presence.

144339	Love	144339.jpg	Trust is one of the most powerful tools. One can either make or break a person, with the trust they have been entrusted. Many times people remain faithful to you, keep the promises and can win your trust. But, it is also a matter of the fact that some people will deceive you. No matter how good you are, you will be cheated many times. It is therefore very much advisable that you don‚Äôt trust everyone easily. Trust is built and maintained by many small actions over time. Trust is not a matter of technique, tricks, or tools but of character. We are trusted because of our way of being, not because of our polished exteriors or our expertly crafted communications. There‚Äôs no doubt that trust is quite possibly the most important quality a relationship can have. Without it, even the strongest Love is bound to fall apart. In a strong relationship, you will probably recognize these behaviors as a normal part of setting into more of a routine and relaxed life together. Without trust, however, even the smallest things an seem like a ‚Äúmake or break?situation. While that may be exciting, it‚Äôs also not healthy. At times it can be tempting to stay in these types of relationships. We think that uncertainty and drama is what true love is made of. But the reality is that, in the long run, they will not make you happy. With that all being said, life is still messy and can be overwhelming at times. So it might feel like we are stuck in the middle of a dramatic scene. But the best part about life is that it goes on and you always find a way. Either the drama broke your relationship or made you stronger. (at Genova, Italy)

144372	Love	144372.jpg	UNA MUJER DEBE TENER? En su control, el dinero suficiente para moverse y rentar un lugar para ella misma, aunque nunca lo desee aunque no lo necesite. Algo perfecto que ponerse si en una hora requiere de estar lista, para una cita de trabajo o la perfecta cita amorosa. UNA MUJER DEBE TENER? Una juventud que se enorgullece dejar atr√°s. Un pasado jugoso, que espera con ansias contar cuando sea mayor. UNA MUJER DEBE TENER? Un par de desarmadores, un taladro y un brassiere de encaje negro. Una amistad que la haga re√≠r y una que la acompa√±e a llorar. UNA MUJER DEBE TENER? Un buen mueble que no haya pertenecido a nadie mas en su familia. Ocho platos que hagan juego, con copas altas para vino y una receta especial para lucirse con sus invitados. La sensaci√≥n de tener control sobre su destino. TODA MUJER DEBE SABER? COMO ENAMORARSE SIN PERDERSE A ELLA MISMA, como renunciar a un trabajo, terminar con un amante, confrontar a un amigo sin arruinar la amistad, CUANDO INTENTAR CON MAS GANAS, Y CUANDO MARCHARSE. TODA MUJER DEBE SABER? Que no puede cambiar el largo de sus pantorrillas, el ancho de sus caderas, ni la naturaleza de sus padres. Que su infancia pudo no haber sido perfecta, pero ya se termin√≥. TODA MUJER DEBE SABER? QUE HAR√çA Y QUE NO HAR√çA POR AMOR Como vivir sola, aunque no le guste. TODA MUJER DEBE SABER? En quien puede confiar, en quien no, y porque no debe tomarlo personalmente. TODA MUJER DEBE SABER? A donde ir, cuando su alma busque consuelo, ya sea a la cocina de su mejor amiga o por un paseo en el bosque. TODA MUJER DEBE SABER? Lo que puede y no puede hacer en un d√≠a, en un mes y en un a√±o. ~ Maya Angelou

144720	Love	144720.jpg	Tarot Today - One of my favourite vintage cards - The Key. I love this card, I could stare at it for hours. If only we could all find the magic key that would unlock our perfect life. What this means to me is being able to unlock whatever it is internally that makes us feel complete. No external force can do that for you. Love, Money anything you can name will not make you happy, it must come from inside. I had a one sided! heated debate with someone yesterday about me being a psychic. I said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt identify as a psychic, lots of my friends do, & that‚Äôs fine. I see myself as a Cartomancer, literally a card reader if you want to go & have a look at wikipedia? He completely ignored what I said & continued to wind himself up until we parted ways. For all I know he is still going on. I got on my bike, came home & continued to play with my pretty cards. Be who you are today, try not to be labelled. Unless you want to label yourself of course. Connect to that part of you that makes you truly happy, that is really all we can do. üîë ‚ù§Ô∏è üîÆ (at London, United Kingdom)

144924	Love	144924.jpg	You are holding a cup of coffee when someone comes along and bumps into you or shakes your arm, making you spill your coffee everywhere. Why did you spill the coffee? ‚ÄúWell because someone bumped into me, of course!? Wrong answer. You spilled the coffee because there was coffee in your cup. Had there been tea in the cup, you would have spilled tea. *Whatever is inside the cup, is what will spill out.* Therefore, when life comes along and shakes you (which WILL happen), whatever is inside you will come out. It‚Äôs easy to fake it, until you get rattled. *So we have to ask ourselves?‚Äúwhat‚Äôs in my cup?? When life gets tough, what spills over? Joy, gratefulness, peace and humility? Or anger, bitterness, harsh words and reactions? Today let‚Äôs work towards filling our cups with gratitude, forgiveness, joy, words of affirmation; and kindness, gentleness and love for others. üôåüèªüôèüèªüôåüèª

She‚Äôs literally able to sense when he‚Äôs feeling anxious and goes to him, it gets him out of self just long enough to break free from that negative emotion. It can almost always calm him down, without even realizing it. She‚Äôs been with him since he was born but we were never intentionally looking for ways out of our negative thinking. He‚Äôs 11, he‚Äôs being equipped with skills I‚Äôve only recently learned. Gratitude.

146154	Love	146154.jpg	Instead of arguing or fighting with your loved one when they are in the valley learn to recognize it. And love them through it. Our loved ones and even ourselves don‚Äôt always make the ‚Äúright?decisions. But with the assistance from the Holy Spirit i was able to convey a loving positive message rather than nag, argue, accuse or ignore that my significant other is hurting. Rather than put the focus on ‚Äúme?as a lot of us do. I cried out to God and asked for his guidance. 7 years ago I met an amazing fun outgoing bubbly man. Today this man is struggling but I love him harder bc I know this is not who he is. This is not who God showed me he is. Sometimes we can‚Äôt do it alone and need a push from a loved one. But be careful don‚Äôt turn a push into a shove. Be their stability in a world that to them seems to be falling apart.

We have all failed at something and if people make fun of you or gossip about your failures than that means they are sooo perfect that they fail at nothing?! Have a fabulous Wednesday!!

146989	Love	146989.jpg	Giving Love to Those with Mental Illness on Valentine‚Äôs Day! On this ‚Äúday of love?we often forget those who need love the very most. We take for granted that we have love to give and share. We don‚Äôt even give a second thought to those who are suffering from ‚Äúlove deficiencies? People with mental illness often feel a great deal of loneliness, especially on a holiday like Valentine‚Äôs Day. They feel that no one truly loves them, and the very thought of this day can be devastating to them. To them it‚Äôs not just another day of being alone. This day of aloneness seems a million times more painful. Please reach out to those who need love this Valentine‚Äôs Day. This special day is not just for lovers. It is a day to ‚ÄúSPREAD THE LOVE? I hope you will reach out to someone just to show you care. On this Valentine‚Äôs Day, I am giving away FREE eBook copies of How to Survive Depression from February 14, 2019 through February 18, 2019, to all who go to my Amazon page and request a totally free copy. No purchase, no obligation. It is just my way of spreading the love this year on Valentine‚Äôs Day! www.amazon.com/author/allenstephanie

147267	Love	147267.jpg	with from a wise and powerful spirit. üôèüèæGrateful everything I‚Äôve been imparting-wrapped in a bow. „Éª„Éª? A bond can be solid and it can also be broken if there is any sign of weakness. It is our job to define who we are in this life and in love. The lesson will show it‚Äôs face at the oddest of ways and often through a soul that is closet to us. Relationships without struggle or some sort of test will not allow both parties to see if they can live with the other forever or fornever! This is what a bond looks like. You name it we have probably been through it and then some yet we are still here. Love requires more than simply saying the words. It requires trust, understanding, passion, stability, accountability, etc In Order to see any signs of success. We are love and once we removed the unnecessary blinders it was easy to see just how much of and in love we are! ‚ù§Ô∏è you mean the world to me and I understand your passion and how deeply you love. The true testament is knowing we have accepted this journey together as one in order to heal, maintain balance and a safe space for us to continue to expand our love! What matters most is what we are to each other and how well we love one another. I love you for so many reasons!!!

147418	Love	147418.jpg	14 Days of Love üíï üëª üëø - Sam and Dean Winchester (Supernatural) These two are the odd men out, pun intended üòä being as they were never a couple and never will be. However, they are one of my favorites due to the familial love between them, which at times seems stronger than any romantic love. Their bond began as children when their father was off chasing monsters, leaving Dean (the oldest of the two) and Sam to fend for themselves. This resulted in Dean, for the most part, raising Sam. As adults their bond has strengthened due to a series of tragedies and their ongoing work in battling the many forms of evil in the world. However, it hasn‚Äôt been all unicorns and rainbows for these two, for they argue, disagree, lie to each other (in an attempt to protect each other), walk away from each (when their relationship reach the breaking point), but always come back each another. And with these reunions, the core of their relationship never changes, for they have (and are always willing) literally died to save the other, gone to hell for each other, sold their souls for each other. üòî‚ù§Ô∏è They are everything to each other, and maybe to some that makes this relationship co-dependent and thus unhealthy, their love for one another is beautiful. üòä

All things not-of-LOVE, including our thoughts, not only feel wretched here, but they will be incessantly amplified like a divine highlighter showing us what needs to be faced, and/or eradicated‚Ä¶without reprieve. Nothing is ever done TO us, we create, miscreate and uncreate it all. Stepping into our power means taking full responsibility for what we think and how we feel‚Ä¶including and especially about ourselves‚Ä¶and putting those thoughts and feelings in action. This is the only way to freedom. üì∏:

Her greatest problem is the size of her bust, which often gets in the way of her heroics and causes a lot of unwanted attention from lecherous trolls (literal trolls, not the internet kind). Gwyddhienne is a friend‚Äôs character from WoW. I hope y'all like the pose xD I researched a lot of ‚Äúbatman on roof?pictures to get inspired. Kudos to all those amazing batman artists!

150565	Love	150565.jpg	RULES OF ENGAGEMENT Of all the ways human beings meet and interact, we only remember the two extremes of love and war. But conflict and alliance are inseparable, interchangeable even in the constant ebb and flow of human relating. We know that moving forward needs collaboration among the diverse. We throw about platitudes like ‚ÄòOpposites attract? a statement that only focuses on the superficial drama of early meetings. So there is firepower. So what? Without direction, that‚Äôs just fireworks that fizzle out in a few breaths, burning oxygen, making it harder for everybody to breathe. Look up to the sky to remember what you are becoming or what you could be. A firework or a cathedral. Trust? How is that to be built between people primed to see each other as foes? 'Friendly opponents?is a temporary white flag one may wave but maybe some differences run too deep for the truce to last very long. And then, it‚Äôs back to the stomach of a volcano, combat to death, anything goes. We do this with words now and with silent actions that leave invisible wounds science still can‚Äôt heal. We cheat, we snipe, we ghost, we block, we brag. We hold up our perfection as a way to slice the other person‚Äôs flaws. And they retaliate, not with swordplay but with a cup of sweetness, already poisoned beforehand. Who bears blame for this war? We may as well live in blood-stained medieval times then, for all that we remember about collaboration, respect and growth. Love is a taboo word in our times but it‚Äôs the only solution proposed in every text, every wise truism, every question asked about how to deal with conflict. Maybe it is an inadequate answer or an outdated one or a silly one but it is the only one. It takes two to start a fight and only one to end it. But maybe you are not strong enough to be that one, maybe the other person isn‚Äôt whatever they need to be for it to be more than fireworks. It doesn‚Äôt really matter. The rules of engagement are very clear. Either you survive together. Or you both burn.

To wake up everyday feeling good about yourself, confident in God‚Äôs promises for you. To take care of yourself, to sleep, eat, laugh, smile, and rest well. Listen to your favorite music, make silly jokes, live your life to the fullest. Being determined and persistent without losing your joy. To sail through seas of doubts, certain about the fact that what lies ahead you will be able to face with God‚Äôs power. Looking at the mirror, and liking what you see. Loving yourself in and out, as I do. Learning from your past, enjoying your present, and being hopeful for the future. I want so much for you, it may seem too much at times. But overall, I just want you to feel loved, to feel happy with who you are and what you have.

Yuan Longping has grown dozens of varieties of rice in sand and diluted seawater on the outskirts Dubai, where fresh water is too precious to use for growing water-intensive crops (rice is traditionally grown in soil and freshwater) While scientists in some countries where water shortages are a serious concern ?such as Israel or Australia ?have been developing desalination techniques to convert seawater for use in agriculture, China has been working to develop strains of salt-resistant rice for the past four decades. China and Dubai also signed an agreement to promote seawater rice across the Arab world, in order to reduce the risk of food shortages in the future. Source: South China Morning Post (Link in bio) -

152414	Love	152414.jpg	How are you treating yourself this Sunday üåª ????? Most of us treat ourselves in ways we would *never* treat someone else. In fact, most of us go *out of our way* to treat others far better than we treat ourselves. We talk to (and about) our selves in ways that we would easily recognize as abuse if it were being done to someone else. We push past and break our own boundaries *constantly* and don‚Äôt respect our needs (e.g. i‚Äôm really sick, but i promised my friends/partner i would go, even though i need to rest and it will make me sicker. Also, we should have friends/partners that *want us to do what‚Äôs best for us*, not who would want us to be worse off). Normalizing abusive relationships with ourselves helps to normalize a culture of abuse at large. It lays the ground work for harmful and toxic relationships and sets a heartbreaking model for any children or youth in your life who are always watching and learning from you. This is an area of transformative justice that we don‚Äôt often talk about, but is critical that we address if we are serious about ending cycles of violence, harm and abuse?and building loving relationships with each other, which starts with building loving relationships with ourselves. So, do something loving for yourself this weekend. And if you can‚Äôt do it this weekend, plan it for as soon as you can. Do something that you need, something that is good for you. Practice talking to yourself the way you would talk to someone you love. Try being as gentle with yourself as would be with a small child. Practice respecting your boundaries the way you would respect someone else‚Äôs boundaries. Try showing up for yourself the way you would rush to show up for your folks. üíòü¶ãüåø? thanks, for creating this image!

[Chorus: Roxette] I know there‚Äôs something in the wake of your smile. I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yea. You‚Äôve built a love but that love falls apart. Your little piece of heaven turns too dark. Listen to your heart happiness

154041	Love	154041.jpg	The first day I met Cash he knew I was gonna be his new mom. üòÇüê∂üíï That day Adam and I met for our first date at Starbucks (we met thru Plenty of Fish - yes, an actual online dating success story! Haha!), and then (when we each decided the other wasn‚Äôt a crazy person - cuz believe me, I‚Äôve had that happen too? we took our beasties for a hike. Roxidoo and I hopped in the truck with Adam to drive to the trail head, and the next thing I knew, I had a black lab sitting in my lap. üòç He just jumped into the front seat and planted his butt in my lap and refused to move until we arrived at the trail head. ü§£ Crazy buddy. üíï Roxie and Cash became instant pals. I have NEVER seen 2 dogs get along and play as well as these two do. They are two peas in a pod. I never thought I could love another bestie as much as I love my Roxidoo, but this guy has stolen a piece of my heart. He and Roxie have such different passions and personalities, and I love them both with my whole heart. üíñüê∂üê∂üíñ (ok?maybe Roxie still has 1% more than Cash does, hehe!) I feel so blessed to have these fur babies in my life! üíû

154579	Love	154579.jpg	‚ÄòFor you will not abandon my soul to Sheol, or let your holy one see corruption?(Psalm 16:10) There are many prophecies concerning our Lord Jesus Christ in the book of Psalms. His coming on the earth, his ministry, his sufferings and the death that he died for the mankind are all prophesied in the book of Psalms. The above prophecy is also about him and it talks about his resurrection. The word ‚ÄòSheol?is a Hebrew term which means ‚Äògrave? So, it implies that Jesus will not be abandoned in the grave forever, as the almighty God will raise him up. As prophesied, after his death, God raised him up on the third day and thus he was not in the grave forever. We see apostle Peter uses this same verse in the book of Acts in the New Testament to preach the good news of the gospel (Acts 2:22-41). Truly, the resurrection of Jesus Christ is a good news for all of us. Because, scripture says, through Jesus Christ there is a hope of resurrection for everyone! If we walk in the path of Jesus and hold on to his teachings, God will also raise us up from the grave one day, and glorify us with the eternal blessings. Amen!

Quando si assume ci sono una serie di sintomi fisici e psicologici facilmente riconoscibili, √® il modo in cui il nostro corpo reagisce a questo momento magico e quasi inspiegabile. Sintomi che compaiono appena siamo vicini alla persona interessata. Ecco quali sono! Sintomi fisici * Battito cardiaco accelerato; * respirazione alterata; * sudorazione eccessiva; * sensazione di ‚Äúfarfalle nello stomaco?e testa vuota che pu√≤ portare alle vertigini; * diminuisce la voglia di mangiare. Sintomi psicologici * Non si smette di pensare alla persona desiderata c‚Äô?un desiderio costante di starle accanto; * le ansie che viviamo ogni giorno passano in secondo piano. Ci sentiamo quindi anche meno stressati; * siamo pi√π predisposti a fare follie e cresce la nostra autostima: ci sentiamo invincibili; * anche le cose pi√π semplici fatte con la persona desiderata diventano straordinarie; * √® forte la voglia di intimit√† e di fare l'amore in modo romantico. Perch√© assumerlo fa?bene alla salute. Aiuta a dimagrire: fare l'amore aiuta a bruciare i grassi e a ritrovare la forma fisica e il battito del cuore accelerato favorisce il dimagrimento. Assumerlo in poche quantit√† fa perdere l'appetito, diminuendo gli attacchi di fame. Pelle pi√π luminosa: stimola la produzione di ossitocina, un ormone che rilascia a sua volta un altro ormone, la DHEA, che contribuisce a contrastare l'invecchiamento, favorendo il rinnovamento cellulare. Questo ormone aiuta anche a ridurre lo stress. Mantiene attivo il cervello: anche se quando siamo sotto effetto del siero sembriamo costantemente con la testa fra?le nuvole in realt√† il farmaco rende il nostro cervello pi√π attivo e produttivo aumentando creativit√† e memoria. Dona energia: assumendolo il piccole dosi il siero ci rende intraprendenti, energici, facendoci sentire capaci di poter fare tutto.

156075	Love	156075.jpg	7. In which area of my life do these demons show up most often? It‚Äôs always too much and not enough at the same time. Most people‚Äôs vices are tangible - alcohol, drugs, sex. Mine can be witnessed if you know me well. I am the beast and also the captives. A rigid perfectionist with OCD, I am my own hellacious task master constantly pushing myself to do and be more. And my mind never stops, never rests. It feels uncomfortable not to analyze something. I could never change this about myself. It‚Äôs part of who I am. I can only learn the cheat codes and hacks for working around these parts of myself. So far I know that giving my brain focus by reading books, learning new perspectives, reading cards is the best use of that constant stream of thought. Woe betide s/he whose behavior becomes the subject of the obsessive analysis in my mind. I will beat your dead horse by asking you how you feel about every possible consideration regarding how you could have achieved ____ and furthermore what the unfolding chain of events following ____ will feel like to yourself and the postal clerk down the street on Tuesday at noon. Meditation gives it rest. I am that too much woman and I don‚Äôt give a damn how intrusive I am in conversation with strangers. I would rather die than talk about the weather or the fact that it‚Äôs Monday. In between stretches of intensity I am a hermit. Too much and not enough. However - balance.

156202	Love	156202.jpg	The Sun works overtime this week, taking meetings with three planets after being eclipsed last Saturday night. You may not realize it yet, but the way you approach all your life‚Äôs circumstances has shifted, likely delivering you to a more grounded, more take charge way of getting things done. This promises to serve you well, as it helps you to shine so much more light and love into everything you do. That‚Äôs important, because it‚Äôs what you do best. Do what you can to consider your efforts creative projects. You‚Äôre never happier or more productive than when you‚Äôre creating from the heart. When the Sun comes together with Pluto on Friday, it brings a surge of energy that will deliver you all the way to May. There are no retrograde planets to slow you down for a while, so resolve to enjoy the ride. ‚ôåÔ∏è‚ôåÔ∏è‚ôåÔ∏è‚ôåÔ∏è‚ôåÔ∏è‚ôåÔ∏è‚ôåÔ∏è‚ôåÔ∏è‚ôåÔ∏è‚ôåÔ∏è‚ôåÔ∏è‚ôåÔ∏è‚ôåÔ∏è Leo- there have been definite shifts going on inside of you Leo, and that‚Äôs because you‚Äôre starting to realize that you‚Äôre not connected to your heart. But entering 2019 you will be taking more action to pamper yourself and DO things for yourself. You can love and be generous to others all you want, but if you‚Äôre not doing the same for yourself then what‚Äôs the point? Your happiness matters and you need to take charge of your life again. Do it for you, and only you Leo.

156583	Love	156583.jpg	Day 365 - Pakistan üáµüá∞ Islamabad, Marathon 101 of 196 ? First marathon of the year = Horrendous ü§™ 95 remaining. ? This time last year I landed in Toronto for marathon number 1; it was -25¬∞c! Today was warmer but wet, cold, busy, boring, exhausting, and did I mention wet. ? I arrived into Islamabad at 05:30 this morning. It took an hour to get through immigration and collect my bag, and then another 45 minutes to reach my hotel. ? At 07:30 I was in bed and managed to nap for about 2 hours before beginning the pre run running ritual and then getting my clothes on. No time for breakfast or drinks this morning. Run time. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇ?? Within 10 minutes of today‚Äôs marathon I had to turn around. I headed back to the hotel to remove my compression socks and instead run with normal non running socks. This is the first time I‚Äôve not run in compression for about 4 years?you can imagine what my legs were saying to me. Rehband compression is utterly fab and I‚Äôd recommend them to anyone; however, due to my trapped nerve around my left ankle this was causing me extra pain to the point that running or even walking was virtually impossible without loud swearing. ? Socks change complete, I restarted my watches and headed out. The rain today was constant, heavy and caused flooding everywhere. That‚Äôs not an exaggeration. I ran for about 20 miles in shin high dirty water. The puddles were so bad that I had to run in the middle of the road in oncoming traffic to try and keep myself upright. I was aquaplaning. And if you thinks I can‚Äôt possibly have run in the middle of the road in oncoming traffic - I really did, was the only way. ? 26.2 miles and 4 hours later I‚Äôve collapsed on the floor of my hotel, naked and with every item of clothing hanging up to dry. I had no idea my pants could hold so much water. ? Finally I want to say a huge thanks to my dear friend Razi for organising a great contact here in the city. A driver from the airport, plus directions for the route, and even dinner tomorrow night. Thanks Pakistan, next time less rain please. ?

158230	Love	158230.jpg	It‚Äôs been a great an tumultuous year. I have taken the time to do the things that I love with this amazing person that I have found and that I also love. I have found looking at the past and the future and am continuously inspired by this: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt read and write poetry because it‚Äôs cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for. To quote from Whitman, ‚ÄúO me! O life!?of the questions of these recurring; of the endless trains of the faithless?of cities filled with the foolish; what good amid these, O me, O life??Answer: that you are here; that life exists, and identity; that the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse; that the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. What will your verse be?? (at Fayetteville, Georgia)

158351	Love	158351.jpg	I think my 2018 year in music started with rearranging my studio in a new house along with some cool local performances (Division Gallery, Takoi) Australian love was big this year in my work with the Chubby! crew (an Ewan Jansen remix I did together with Mike Grant) and Red Ember Records (Deepsounds Three compilation). Made some cool new beats and multiple tracks from my spring demo ended up being released or attracting the attention of multiple labels & that was exciting. Made some cool new music friends & business partners. Spring tour was amazing and though I enjoyed my work & downtime throughout Europe, it was tough being away from my family for a whole month. Mad love to Mr P. Booking for everything! Also big thanks to my hosts and all the venues + artists. I found a great Ypsilanti spot called Ziggy‚Äôs and will definitely be performing there again. Songs from my recent releases on Moods & Grooves + Third Ear (cop that vinyl) continued to buzz and I am grateful. Several of my songs were featured on compilation cassettes released by two new French labels; Le Petit Zoo and Magic Black. I updated my studio and have resumed private teaching/tutoring and recording sessions, ask about it. Kept doing the Really Nice Trips podcast on rewindit.fm & that‚Äôs been fun. Had good times at Old Miami with DJ Los & Supa Emcee. Thanks, Woo. Finished up the year (more Australian love) with a rap feature for the dope homey Inkswel on the Apparel Tronic label. Hi, SCHiLLiNG! Oh yeah, I almost forgot about the digital release of my Work The Terminals EP on Moods & Grooves. I probably missed something or someone (I am sorry) cuz my memory is crap, but I am supremely thankful for everything and everyone. 2018 was quite a ride. See you soon, 2019. ü•≥üé∂

158961	Love	158961.jpg	Okay. So let me explain. A revolutionary song (as I define it) is a song the character/a person listens to or sings when they‚Äôre in their time of ‚Äúletting go of a burden?like in mean girls the musical when Janice sings I‚Äôd rather be me, or in Hamilton when eliza sings burn. Or the way Evan sings ‚Äúcause I‚Äôve learned to slam on the brake?in words fail. Also, another thing about revolutionary songs is that it can be a ‚Äúrealization?So fireflies by owl city is there because that song makes Aaron realize he has a soft side of himself. Some characters have more than one realization about themselves so they can have more than one revolutionary song. It‚Äôs all apart of how a line in the song is being said, or the genre of the song and the lyrics, depending on the characters personality. Their favorite songs are there to show their normal style/taste in songs. I will be regularly updating this and more notes. To understand what all of this is for, please click the link in my bio.

159153	Love	159153.jpg	This is my man y‚Äôall. üë´ üíãüçÜ‚ô•Ô∏è STORYTHYME: üåø üïó Since I‚Äôve explored the world of relationships, I realized that I‚Äôm the type of person that is too damn emotional. I‚Äôve always been dependent on the love of someone else to just feel as if I need to even go on. Now as the new year approaches, I naturally tend to reevaluate my life. Meaning that I go into a bubble of not being present & I am there now. I‚Äôve been married to this guy for 2 years & 5 months & counting. One day we will overcome our regular lives & finally live the life promised to us, we will be rich, we will have a big house, he‚Äôll have his fast cars, he‚Äôll father my children (for now we‚Äôre just practicing), & we will work on our promise of forever & always. üïä So here‚Äôs to forever right As always (at Garden City, New York)

Entre broma y broma siempre mencionamos que todas mis fotos tienen un tono morado en su edici√≥n; pero es que antes no ten√≠an color alguno.

160262	Love	160262.jpg	‚ÄúThe one thing I know for sure is that feelings are rarely mutual, so when they are, drop everything, forget belongings and expectations, forget the games, the 2 days between texts, the hard to gets because this is it, this is what the entire world is after and you‚Äôve stumbled upon it by chance, by accident. So take a deep breath, take a step forward, now run, collide like planets in the system of a dying sun, embrace each other with both arms and let all the rules, the opinions and common sense crash down around you. Because this is love kid and it‚Äôs all yours. Believe me you are in for one hell of a ride after all- this is the one thing I know for sure.?- Beau Taplin HaraMouschou.com Facebook | Instagram | YouTube

Kissing the lips arouses a lot of feelings but there are also other places to kiss her that can make her feel special. A kiss on the lips is sweet and leads to the main thing but we also appreciate a kiss on the forehead, neck, cheeks, shoulder, ears, nose, jaw and chin. These places can have different effects on your lady so why dont you try been extra romantic. Kiss with emotion. Make her feel your heart and thoughts in just that kiss. Follow for more tips

161055	Love	161055.jpg	When we are going through a difficult time, we may hesitate to call even our best friends because we don‚Äôt want to burden them with our troubles. This can be especially true if we‚Äôve been going through a series of challenges, and we‚Äôre starting to feel as if we sound like a broken record. It is important to remember that at times like these our friends sincerely want to be there for us whenever they can. We can always check with them to make sure it‚Äôs a good time for them before we start talking, and if it‚Äôs not a good time, we can call back at another time, or call another friend. We know for ourselves that when we have a good friend, we don‚Äôt want them to suffer alone when we are just a phone call away. We want them to call us and share their sorrows with us, as well as their joys, because this is what sharing a life through is about. It is at our lowest points that we really need to rely on our friends without worrying that we are a burden. If you are feeling self-conscious about having a tough time, you can bring this fact into the conversation by acknowledging it. Chances are your friend will reassure you that she is happy to be there for you. In fact, rather than feeling taxed, most of us feel better when we have helped a friend simply by listening empathically while they share their feelings. Without our friends, we would be hard pressed to get through the tough times and celebrate the good ones. If we leave our friends out of our process when the going gets tough, our friendships can begin to feel shallow. On the other hand, when we include our friends in the full story of our life‚Äìthe good, the bad, and the ugly‚Äìwe build authentic relationships in which we can be who we truly are. When we do this, we invite our friends to bring their whole selves to the relationship as well.

161147	Love	161147.jpg	Only 4, yes 4 sleeps to Christmas Yayyyyyyy?Exciting? The Birth Was the Beginning The message of Christmas doesn‚Äôt end with the tiny baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger. We must remember the reason that baby was born. The full message of Christmas is that eternal God came to earth as a man to save His own creation. That tiny baby in swaddling clothes came for a purpose: He came to die. Those tiny infant hands that twitched and worked themselves out of their wrappings within a rough wooden feeding trough were the very same carpenter‚Äôs hands that later were nailed to a rugged, wooden cross. They were the same hands that, though scarred, carefully folded His own burial wrappings after defeating sin and death so that He might give us eternal life. And they are the same hands that lovingly reach down and pick us up over and over again. Have a merry Christmas y'all

163326	Love	163326.jpg	Cuando eleg√≠ mi camino, sab√≠a que iba a haber heridos. Tambi√©n sab√≠a que hab√≠a gente que iba a salir de mi vida. D√©jame contarte mi historia. Una historia en la que aun no tengo 17 a√±os. En aquellos momentos cre√≠a que ya era mayor para enfrentarme a este mundo, pero me equivoque. Sab√≠a que el mundo no iba a cambiar s√≥lo para complacerme, sabia eso, porque el mundo es el mundo y nunca dejara de ser lo. A mis 17 a√±os viaje por mi cuenta a un pa√≠s que para mi era totalmente desconocido. Un lugar que me dio mucho por aprender. Un asunto lastimo mi paisaje dejando mis ojos irritados. Vi personas que se cre√≠an mejores por vestir con marca pero no por marcar la diferencia, personas que se cre√≠an mejores por los bienes que poseen pero no por lo bienes que daban. Me tolere a tomar distancia eterna con duraci√≥n correcta. Una con comienzo y final .Como todo lo que comienza termina, mis d√≠as terminaron. Mis 18 a√±os se cumplieron y volv√≠ a tomar un camino. Uno donde pod√≠a sentir la brisa del mar. Estoy en mi presente.El ahora. Se que tengo una sabidur√≠a que s√≥lo quiere mi bien. No siempre la entiendo, pero nunca la cuestiono. Hay cosas que de tan simple parecen tambi√©n tan extra√±as. Pero la verdad es que son sorprendentes. Traen vida. Tiene voluntad propia. Son parte de quien soy. No importa si es de ti o de alguien mas. No dejes que nada te moleste. No dejes que nada te quite tu paz. No aceptes que entre en tu vida quien no te entiende o te guste. Libera tu esp√≠ritu de todo lo que te retiene. Parte a los lugares que gritan por tu alma. Parte a vivir en el momento. No te preocupes por el final. Vive en el momento de cada momento y en el intervalo de cada tiempo.

163378	Love	163378.jpg	Can I ask you all a favour? Tell them you love them and that they are important. Listen to their wisdom and advice because they only want what‚Äôs best for you. Spend time with them and no matter how bad you think you look, take that photo with them. Make memories, share memories. After all, that‚Äôs what life‚Äôs about right? The times we share, no matter how brief. 25 years is a long time to miss someone. To wonder if what you remember about them is right or just a fantasy made up from little memories you have and stories you are told. It‚Äôs a long time to wish you knew them better and had more time with them. It gets easier, that‚Äôs true, but you never really stop wondering and missing. Even after 25 years, I miss you mum, I miss what you have missed and will miss, the memories we could have made and the photos we never got to take. But you are forever and always in my heart.

164767	Love	164767.jpg	DARKENING OF THE LIGHT Darkness reigns in the external world now. Disengage from negative feelings and maintain your inner light. This is a time when darkness and inferior energies surround you. The image is that of the sun completely swallowed by the earth. The only light left is that inside your own heart, and you are counseled to return to it, maintain it, and quietly nourish yourself with it. It is in the dark moments that a correct attitude is most important. If we fight against the darkness, we are swallowed by it and suffer great misfortune. If we react to the lack of visible progress with despair and negativity, we extinguish our own inner light and block the aid of the Creative. If we try to persuade others that they must return to the light, we exhaust ourselves in vain now. In a time such as this, it is wise to adopt a stance of outer disengagement and inner perseverance. Do not focus on or interact with the negative influences around you; this only strengthens their grip on you. Step aside, yield, let go, allow people and events to pass without attachment. Direct your attention inside, to your inner light, your devotion to what is right, your conversation with the Higher Power. Progress may be slow, but there will indeed be progress. Remember that much of the work of the Higher Power is hidden from us, and that we enable and assist it by remaining detached, accepting, and reserved in the face of negative influences. FIRST LINE Your ego is unsatisfied with the path of correctness. However, to strive out of desire or despair will bring misfortune. Cling to what is calm and good no matter what others do, and allow the Creative to work in its own time.

The Christmas Box Angel Statue, these statues were created by Richard Paul Evans from a book he wrote called The Christmas Box. It is a very powerful story about the loss of a child. And these statues are dedicated to all of the parents who have lost a child. Every December 6th across the country people meet at these statues and leave flowers,teddy bears, pictures and tokens of love. I was working last night and wanted to get out to support the people that have lost a child. So I stopped out tonight and left some flowers to show love and support to all the families that have lost a child. PRAYERS ARE WITH THEM ALL. And a special THANK YOU to my friend for showing me where this was and the story behind it. Richard Paul Evans has many great books. You should check his stuff out. (at Zion United Methodist Church)

165401	Love	165401.jpg	ABOUT ME I am Novy Jeen Rodaste Reodava. 18 years old. From Martelino Subdivision Andagao, Kalibo, Aklan. I graduated my junior high school in Regional Science High school - VI and my senior high school in STI College Kalibo. Currently, I am a first year college student in Aklan State University Banga Campus and taking up the course, Doctor of Veterinary Medicine. I have 2 sisters and I‚Äôm the middle child. I‚Äôm not that close to them because sometimes I get very moody. I‚Äôm much closer to my cousins and friends because I feel more comfortable in expressing my feelings to them. My sisters Cousins Friends (Lots of good friends). LOL I really love to draw because through it, I can express my creativity and it also helps me to externalize my emotions. Actually, no one taught me to draw maybe it‚Äôs just a pure talent. HA HA It really showed a lot of improvements through time and experiences. From anime to portraits. So here are some of it? I know you would think I‚Äôm smart because I have the guts to take up this course and also the fact that we will have to spend 6 years in college or more depending on your diligence. Well, honestly veterinary medicine is not my first choice and being an architect is my dream. I know that I have a passion in drawing and design since I was a kid but I think architecture is not really meant for me so I gave up that dream when I was in senior high school. On that time, we have a thoughtful calculus teacher and you can see it from him that he really wants us to understand and love his subject. Simple mathematics is okay with me but complex math is indeed hard for me to understand. When I reached grade 12, I felt confused and pressured on what course I should take in college. It really took me a couple of months to choose and decide. I want a job that is in line with the things I like besides drawing and arts. Then, I remembered my love for animals and how I want to help them. So, I came up with veterinary medicine. I took up the University exam and put Vet Med as my first choice and Architecture in 2nd, thinking whatever may be the result is according to God‚Äôs plan. Unexpectedly, I passed the exam for Veterinary medicine! :) November 6, 2018. The day I lost my first pet. His name is Shipu. He is very sweet and clingy. When I‚Äôm not okay, he would sat on my lap and purr. Like he grabs my attention in order for me to forget what‚Äôs bothering me. But then, I lost him and I couldn‚Äôt even do a thing to make him feel better. I feel so helpless at that time. On that day I promised to myself to graduate Doctor of Veterinary Medicine no matter what. I want to save the lives of every animals because they deserve to live happily and to feel loved.

Cosas como ordenar todo por tama√±o, color o alfab√©ticamente; tener una man√≠a con el orden de tus implementos, cortar todas las frutas de manera perfecta y hasta siempre salir una hora o dos antes para llegar puntual al lugar de encuentro. Esas peque√±as cosas crean la perfecci√≥n. Cari√±o t√∫ y yo no somos la excepci√≥n, solo hay un peque√±o problema, y es que la vida no quiere que seamos la perfecci√≥n en su m√°gico esplendor.

She becomes a part of a group of women who, disguised as social workers, spy for secret services. But when she is approached by Catherine Wintercourt, who informs her that Saul has disappeared on the northern front, a new way to atone for her sins opens to Eleanor. When she leaves for the Scandinavian Union to look for her husband, she sees it only as a way to clear her conscience. But soon she finds peace amidst the icy hell, and courage so big inside of her that makes her defy a whole army without weapons? Just letting everyone know that I finished book 2 on Wattpad, in case anyone is interested. There will be a book 3, I just need to?get myself to finish it.

167128	Love	167128.jpg	Dear Friend, Let‚Äôs go to God with our worries, cares, and anxieties knowing that He in control of all things. We go to Him with the faith of our LORD and Saviour Jesus Christ, knowing that our Heavenly Father is the only true God Who sent His Son to die for us so we may have eternal life. Knowing this, we come to Him with thanksgiving, with a grateful heart for the work He has done for us, in us and is still doing. While we were yet sinners, God loved us, and sent His only Son, LORD Jesus Christ to died for us. Romans 5:8. What an amazing and miraculous truth! The divine and unmerited gift of salvation should always live in our hearts and minds, so may continuously give thanks unto Him for His unconditional love. This is a commandment. A grateful heart should always be approached to God, even in our deepest, hardest trials and tribulations. Even if we may not understand them. While not forgetting the work He has done and still doing. This truth gives us perfect peace, ‚ÄúIf God be for us, who can be against us??(Romans 8:31) Let‚Äôs take courage, for the true God has power over all our circumstances! Therefore, when we pray, let‚Äôs give God our deepest praise, as we then we give Him our supplications and requests. Knowing His eternal peace is given to us by promise, for He cares about us. ‚ÄúPeace I leave with you; My peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.?-Jesus Christ, John 14:27

When I write every word here. It‚Äôs all you. I taste your salt every time I lick my lips. You scent when I smell your perfume. I hear your voice when I need it most. There is nobody else. No other person. No one. No one has ever done what you do to me. No one ever will. Nothing comes even close. My Kitten. You consume me. The most unhealthy good habit I‚Äôve ever known. You consume me.

167299	Love	167299.jpg	Sometimes it happens. People you have loved for a long time, or a short time, or even both, decide for whatever reason that they cannot be in your life anymore. And it can be painful. _ On the path of chronic illness or seems it happens more frequently than usual, and the path of healing can have the same experience. It can leave you with low self - esteem, no confidence, wondering why, spiraling as you try to figure out what is wrong with you? _ You can lose your self-compassion. _ But listening to the radio shows on Soul‚Äôs Gold and on Compassion, boy they can help. Remembering there is this community of compassionate souls who are on a similar path and reaching out to them when you can‚Äôt find your own self-compassion, they will offer your some of theirs and BAM, there‚Äôs that spark of compassion that reminds you who you really are. _ And then little by little you find yourself again. Buoyed by others?shining lights and love, reminded that we all have different journeys and where, as they say, one door closes another opens. And so you can an begin anew, feeling restored hope, faith, love, willing to be open, willing to be vulnerable, grateful for the path that led you to this grace and beauty. _ Thank you to everyone who reached out and shared their spark. I love you. I treasure you. You make me of a difference than you realize. üíóüíóüíóüíó _ Oh, and I made a video about my recent experiences. Link is in my profile if you care to peep. _

168745	Love	168745.jpg	Whether we like it or want it or not, change is coming. Sometimes we can‚Äôt see that these changes are actually creating a better future for us, so it‚Äôs most often a thing we resist. You can pop that umbrella, but the rain is coming up from the ground and you can‚Äôt even see it. Time and most importantly enlightenment create a centrifugal force that calls these movements toward evolution to you. Don‚Äôt resist the change. Especially if it feels connected to your highest good. Even if it looks and smells like a shit sandwich, it‚Äôs a step forward. Move in the direction the universe guides you. Let it flow and go with it‚Äôs flow. Chances are you‚Äôve been subconsciously asking for it. When it arrives, lean into it and let it take you. üåû Decks: and (at Bull Creek Park, Austin, Texas)

168775	Love	168775.jpg	Love defeat all, but love is defeated by time?Is that true at all? I love this painting by Pierre Mignard ‚ÄúKronos and Cupid? A bunch of symbols speaking of the relationship between Kronos (the time) and Cupid (the love). We can see this painting as the Time defeating the Love. Kronos, muscular, bearded, with a sand clock next to his feet and the scythe, is holding Cupid firmly and cutting off his wings. Cupid arrows are at the floor as symbol of his defeat and without his wings he cannot fly high, as love uses to do. But if we see with attention, the arrows are not broken, they are inside a quiver and are setting carefully at the floor. Kronos is cutting Cupid‚Äôs wings off to make him set foot on the ground, which is a metaphor of using the reason even when you are in love, Cupid is not being defeated, Kronos is simply making him a more realistic love, a love with wings but with the feet on the ground. Time transforms love, it makes it more mature and down-to-earth. With time elder couples learn to accept each other just are they are, with no idealization or distort of the reality, they know the darkest part of each other and embrace them and therefore they love with reason.

Deus nos ama de uma maneira t√£o singular e grandiosa, que enviou Seu Filho √† terra para morrer por n√≥s, miser√°veis pecadores. Jo√£o 13.1 diz que Ele amou os Seus que estavam com Ele at√© o fim. O termo ‚ÄòSEUS?significa aqueles moradores de rua que desprezamos; aquele familiar chato e enfadonho que nos pede ajuda e rejeitamos, por n√£o suport√°-lo; s√£o aquelas pessoas que nos feriram e n√£o perdoamos; √© aquela mulher de m√° fama que julgamos; aquele dependente qu√≠mico que maltratamos e n√£o compreendemos a sua situa√ß√£o. Enfim, os ‚ÄòSEUS? que Jesus amou, somos n√≥s, humanidade pecadora. Entretanto, um dos legados que Ele nos deixou foi o amor ao pr√≥ximo. √â f√°cil amar quem nos faz bem. Precisamos amar a TODOS, sem exce√ß√£o, e nos importar com os menos favorecidos na sociedade, pois ‚ÄúJesus disse-lhe: Amar√°s o Senhor Teu Deus de todo o teu cora√ß√£o, e de toda a tua alma, e de todo o teu pensamento. Este √© o primeiro e grande mandamento. E o segundo, semelhante a este, √©: Amar√°s o teu pr√≥ximo como a ti mesmo?(Mateus 22.37-39).

169917	Love	169917.jpg	Stressed = dessertS Kind of corny, however I was talking to a friend last night and realized the connection to these two words. The spelling of stressed, reversed is desserts. It is sweat that they both have differnet meanings and yet, they work together. Being stressed may not seem good at times, however stress is an internal enotion that kick starts off so much in our bodies. Out blood rushes, our breathing increase, so much is happening to creat a healing for what is coming. Kind of sweet, like desserts. Continual stress can eventually catch up with us and hurt us. Understanding the sweet side of stress of becoming stronger, learning from our reactions, we realize we become better at who we are and can get through anything. So stressed becomes the desserts as we know we have moved through tough things in the past. So remeber, when you are stressed, remember the sweet sid eof it and enjoy your dessert, or victory if getting through it. My book, can help you push through these times maing it easy to push through. www.gilevansbooks.com (at Huron Lightship Historical Marker)

THERE WILL BE DRAMA IN YOUR LIFE BUT THAT DOESN‚ÄôT MEAN YOU HAVE TO SOLVE/DEAL WITH THEM ALL. AND WHATS WORSE IS THAT YOU EVEN RESORT TO CUTTING TUMBLR AND SOCIAL MEDIA OFF, and that may seem like a good solution to you but that also mean cutting off a support line or even your own FRIENDS, Including myself. You may not want to bother me with your problems, but I AM BOTHERED AT THE FACT THAT YOU‚ÄôRE NOT LETTING ME HELP YOU. I DREAD HAVING TO WONDER IF YOU‚ÄôRE EVEN STILL ALIVE SOMETIMES. I AM FIGHTING TEARS WHILE WRITING THIS. I know, some people just SUCK. Life sucks sometimes. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to DEAL or give a SHIT about it to the point where you feel like you‚Äôre SICK and FALLING APART. I know you want to fix things in you're life, but THIS is a problem in ITSELF. YOU ARE WEIGHING YOURSELF DOWN WITH TOO MANY PROBLEMS. THE UNIVERSE MADE YOU FOR A REASON. DON‚ÄôT THINK IT DIDN‚ÄôT. SO PLEASE. TAKE A BREAK. SOME THINGS JUST NEED TO BE LET GO, AND IF YOU THINK THAT THEY CAN‚ÄôT, FOR GOD‚ÄôS SAKE, DON‚ÄôT DO IT ALONE. I know you‚Äôve heard this a thousand times, but things DO get better. But I believe that you don‚Äôt see that YOU COME FIRST. AND THAT‚ÄôS WHATS PREVENTING THINGS FROM GETTING BETTER. Just?.Glitch you mean the WORLD to me. You were my first true best friend in YEARS, and you were what kept me going at times. If I lost you, I don‚Äôt KNOW what I would do. I made you the main character of Dreamist for a REASON. And for everyone seeing this, this also goes to you as well. don‚Äôt ever forget that you MATTER, and that YOUR HEALTH COMES FIRST.

175157	Sad	175157.jpg	See this. This is how deeply some people love. Do you wanna know what‚Äôs really unfortunate about that? Not everyone feels and respects it. Be it family or lovers? If you truly love someone it will fuck. you. up. if/when they betray you. If you‚Äôve been abused mentally, physically, or in any other way: you‚Äôre going to trusting people less and less. You‚Äôll also trust yourself, your own judgements, and your own concept of reality, fairness, and goodness less. You‚Äôre self esteem will be obliterated, and you won‚Äôt even realize because you will just eventually accept that it‚Äôs what you deserve. Even if that obviously isn‚Äôt true. If you‚Äôve been abandoned or cheated on: you‚Äôre not going to believe people can stick around.You‚Äôll never believe you can actually be enough for anyone. You‚Äôll always think ‚Äúwhen will it end??‚ÄúWhen will they get tired of me??‚ÄúWhen will they leave just like I know they will?? So if you ever wonder why some people lay awake at nights staring at wounds and sobbing about the tiniest little details their brain is blowing way out of proportion. Think about what the world may have done to them to get them to that place.

175313	Sad	175313.jpg	My heart is absolutely broken in pieces! Today this world lost an amazing woman who made it so much better by her very presence and spirit. If you were part of the Austin Celtic Festival or St. Patrick‚Äôs Day Austin over the past 20 years, chances are you met the wonderful Cindy Berry at some point along the way. Today she earned her wings after a long, long battle with cancer. I am so thankful that I got to hug her many, many times at the St. Patrick‚Äôs Day celebration this past March. I had found out about her news that there was nothing else that could be done for her. I made it a point to hug her and tell her how much she meant to me as a friend and as a colleague that I was blessed to have in my life for several years. Cindy was an incredible woman and if she counted you as her friend, you were doubly lucky. She is already missed and even though I know she is at rest and at peace, my tears are having a hard time shutting off ever since I found out about the news shortly after she passed on from this life into the next. Among the many reasons I hate to cry and try my hardest to not do it‚Ä¶my eyes feel like they‚Äôve been punched and introduced to a sand storm, all scratchy and watery and swollen at the same time. And, I always end up with the crying headache. UGH! If I‚Äôm crying because of someone, you better believe it‚Äôs because they matter(ed) an unbelievable amount to me and they are/were worth my tears. Everything just hurts. Cancer is a real bitch! I‚Äôll miss your raspy laugh and your quick but tight hugs, Cindy. You were a fighter and a warrior until the very end. Thank you for being my friend. Ar dheis D√© go raibh a h-anam - may her soul be at the right hand of God. üíö‚ù§?

175977	Sad	175977.jpg	My mom found this beautiful Northern Flicker, (a medium species of woodpecker), a week ago today stunned and stranded on the road infront of our house. It appeared that she had been hit by a car. She was unable to fly and seemed to have both a broken wing and a broken leg. I just contacted the wildlife rehabilitation center where we took her to get an update and see how she was doing and her injuries were too severe; they had to euthanize her shortly after intake. I‚Äôm sad. It would be different if she had been devastated and ready to go but she wanted to live so bad! She was such a buggar during the night I had her, biting me when I‚Äôd try and give her an eyedropper of water, trying to jump out of the box constantly?just full of herself and full of spirit even with all of her injuries and broken bones. But I am so thankful she did not suffer and went peacefully instead of dying slowly of starvation or infection or what have you. Sometimes your best just isn‚Äôt enough, and that‚Äôs just life.

176521	Sad	176521.jpg	It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve done this to myself. I don‚Äôt really keep track for when I do it. This picture is of the scratches two days later. There were a lot more little scratches around it that have apparently healed. The misophonia and misokinesia is getting quite annoying now. My mom (who makes the most of my trigger sounds because shes ALWAYS coughing and clearing her throat and sniffling) doesn‚Äôt really care. She makes the sound and I get up to leave so she tells me to sit down, if I do leave, she‚Äôll get mad at me. Sometimes she‚Äôll say sorry and do it again. It‚Äôs embarrassing when she tells others that I don‚Äôt ‚Äúlike?the sounds she makes. I was in the car and I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore so I clawed at my arm. I wear short sleeves at home and no one has noticed so thats cool. I keep on running my fingers over it cuz it still aches. Sadly, I‚Äôve cut my nails really short so I can‚Äôt do some scratching for a while.

177257	Sad	177257.jpg	No es un d√≠a, tampoco son dos, ni tres. A veces estas toda la semana triste. La semana en la que deber√≠as estar contento porque dentro de 6 d√≠as es tu cumplea√±os. La semana en que tendr√≠as que estar ‚Äúbien?y estas mal. Sea por cualquier cosa, estas mal, hasta ni si quiera sabes porque. Simplemente ya es costumbre estar as√≠. La semana en que adem√°s de estar mal, empeoras cuando vas a clases. Se hacen m√°s lentas, y mas agotadoras. Ni si quiera haces lo que hac√≠as antes, te da igual suspender. Te empieza a dar igual todo. Hasta en clase, piensas que no sirves para esto, que deber√≠as irte, desaparecer?Que a la m√≠nima que abres la boca, ya la cagas, y empiezas a pensar que eres un puto idiota que no sabes callarte, cuando en realidad siempre estas callado. Prefieres estar solo, aunque est√©s con alguien, porque a veces ese alguien no te presta ni atenci√≥n y se va con otros. Quieres alejarte un poco m√°s de todos, intentar callarte m√°s, estar solo definitivamente, o ir con alguien que creas que te presta m√°s atenci√≥n. Te afectan los comentarios que dicen de ti, cuando ni si quiera te conocen y te empiezan a juzgar por como eres, cuando en realidad no eres as√≠. Odias a la gente que dice cosas de ti a las espaldas, cuando en realidad no se atreven a dec√≠rtelas en la cara, aunque si te las dijeran no aguantar√≠as, y le pegar√≠as un pu√±etazo. Porque sabes que lo que dice tambi√©n tiene raz√≥n pero igual es mentira. Porque no te conocen lo suficiente como para juzgarte de cualquier manera. Lo que mas te duele de todo esto, es que te lo diga una amiga, que crees que no dir√° nada, cuando la que empieza todo esto es ella.

Not only all of the money he gave away (half or more of his fortune I believe) but he won 8 grammy awards this night!!! On a creepy note, new allegations from a kid who was ten in the same year of this photo. Supposedly Michael was abusing him for the next ten years. Remember, even as a victim becomes an adult, they can be abused sexually. Especially by a sick abuser they already are sickly attached to. R Kelly brainwashes lots of women. I love Michael as the non child but definite drug abuser I know him as. These three guys can‚Äôt get any money from the estate it is too late. Michael is dead so no criminal charges obviously. I guess we will never know for sure. I just have to hope out of all of the people Michael knew that someone will not allow this film to be the ‚Äúlast word on Michael. I just remembered that the families of two of these guys have sued many celebrities families apparently and won for abusing their sons or daughters.

179377	Sad	179377.jpg	I don‚Äôt think of you when it‚Äôs raining. When I cuddle up in my bed in the dark and feel like I‚Äôm the only person in the world. It‚Äôs not when I‚Äôm lonely. Or when I‚Äôm angry, because nothing is working out and I feel like God is really quiet in my stupid life. I don‚Äôt think of you, when I‚Äôm bitter, when I get lost in temporary emotions. I think of you when I feel free, can be myself or when I did something good for my body. When I wake up early, meditate and watch the clouds dance with the rising sun. Or when I finish a book for which I have never found time to read before. I‚Äôm thinking of you when I‚Äôm improving my love for myself. But still it does not mean that I‚Äôm remembering at that time the beautiful moments with you. Even if everything around me is right and I can think clearly, I‚Äôm sad about you often. No matter how happy I can get, you will always be missing. Without the thoughts about that you left and are happier without me, there is no balance in all of this. I couldn‚Äôt appreciate how I successfully meditate for half an our, if I wouldn‚Äôt think in the exact moment about how I collapsed and couldn‚Äôt breathe when I lost you. I couldn‚Äôt enjoy beautiful moments that last for only a little while like a sunset at the sea, if I didn‚Äôt remember at the same time how slowly the days were passing by when you was away for 5 months and how much I‚Äôve fought to stay alive. Slowly, I start believing that those sad memories and thoughts about you are essential for the moments of peace to exist. It sounds like a part of a corny love song, but you give me life. You give me life in so many ways and I don‚Äôt know what to say but that you are just part of my happiness and I don‚Äôt think you will ever understand.

179442	Sad	179442.jpg	The weekend Oh la la?So I spent the week doing the research at the bunker, where several books of a philosopher were stored when she became unable to work, this person lost her mind developing paranoid schizophrenia. It might sound like a clich√© to say that a person goes crazy for reading too much; this is not true, a person cannot lose their mind for just studying too much or whatever. After opening several boxes with her books, also containing personal belongings I sort of mapped the development of her illness, she became ill from sick literature? I remember late in my university studies there was a tendency, and that tendency never really entered the academia. There was a concern during my student‚Äôs days about permeability. Whatever?This poor person got into a philosophical trend, ‚Äúpost-modern?philosophy as it is called. She was reading Butler, the famous Hadaway‚Äôs cyborg bullshit and so on?No wonder she became crazy? It broke my heart because to think in my terms, I see the spirit as a intelligent vital force, and in the case of this person, although she is alive (yet, going around Berlin paranoid) her spirit is dead.

La vida y sus juegos en los que siempre salgo perdiendo, hoy sigo pagando errores que no son m√≠os, que no comet√≠.

182754	Sad	182754.jpg	On Change. When things change, life can be difficult. It can be hard to get used to something new, or different. Change is the one thing we can always count on, eventually. Nothing ever stays the same. So no matter what situation we find ourselves in, the good, or bad, know that change is constant. Also, know that you are not alone. You may not know anyone who‚Äôs going threw the same thing, but there is always someone, somewhere in a similar situation. Possibly even having to handle much worse. You may ask why. You may find no good reason why things have to change in this moment. Waiting to find out why, is incredibly difficult. Some things you wont know till much later. Good can come from change too. *Don‚Äôt automatically think the worst. Prepare as much as possible, & go with it. There is no amount of worry, or stress that will make things stay the same. Life is ever changing. Sometimes, maybe even for the better. Sending much love.‚ô•Ô∏è

183921	Sad	183921.jpg	This is my first tattoo. I‚Äôve never thought I would have a tattoo but then I started to feel the need to remind myself something important, something I always forget: I am powerful. I‚Äôve struggled for a very long time with myself - nowdays my battle isn‚Äôt finished. I always think lower about myself, that I am miserable, incapable of doing things, that I‚Äôm ugly and unworthy. My life has been a rollercastle of bad experiences, of challenges that I believed I could never face. I had a lot of problem not only with myself, but also with school and with my parents. School it‚Äôs a tragic topic: from middle school to high school it has been always a nightmare. Recommendations, preferences, injustices.. everything I did would never be enough. I have no words to describe how horrible and terrifying school has been to me. My self esteem became inexistent. Although I woke up at 4 am to study, I would never succedeed. I started to think that I was stupid and that everyone was better than me. This feeling of inadequacy mixed with my struggle with my body and my bad relationship with my parents led me to think about suicide. I almost committed it. But then I thought that they were not worthy of my depression. I used to define myself as a warrior because despite whatever they would do to me I‚Äôve always raise up and continued to fight, so I decided to become a warrior and fight back with much more power and pride. I can succeeded in school and in fact so I did: I decided to change class and change my friendships and now I‚Äôm one of the best student in my class, I even won a scholarship. I fell in love with my boyfriend and I love him so much, thanks to his support I became much more happy and my self esteem increased to such a point that I went to the beach and I had so so much fun! I couldn‚Äôt believe it! I started to take care of my self, to think first about me and my self care, to realize my dreams and, above all, I stared to become happy and this is a feeling that I‚Äôm proud to have because I have suffered so much before I could have a drop of it. I‚Äôm powerful because I have the power to do everything that I want and nobody can stop me. I decided to do my first tattoo so I could always remind myself what I had to fight to become who I am today and, also, this tattoo is a reminder to be a better person everyday. I am my own saviour. I‚Äôm 18 years old, this battle is long 7 years and I‚Äôm positive it will last other years, but this journery is incredible and now my rollercastle is beautiful and full of good experiences that I‚Äôm looking forward to live! This battle was not easy, I had a lot of breakdown, I cried a lot and, sometimes, I just wanted to give up. But my pride was much stronger than my difficulties, so I continued to do my best for becoming the person I want to be. Believe in yourself and don‚Äôt let anyone take you down because they don‚Äôt deserve your tears. You deserve to be happy, successfull and full of love.	
183981	Sad	183981.jpg	Hop Wilson aka Poppy Hop And His Orchestra - Merry Christmas Darling - 1973 Lap-steel guitar player, Harding ‚ÄúHop?Wilson (April 27, 1921 ?August 27, 1975) was Texas born and bred, and almost unknown outside his home state, but through his influence on Johnny Winter and Jimmie Vaughan, his sound still echoes today. Ronnie Wood is another fan of Hop‚Äôs guitar licks, because Hop could also play a mean slide on a conventional guitar. A contemporary of Clarence ‚ÄòGatemouth?Brown, Hop did not go on to world fame, but his licks turn up all over Texas roadhouse Blues. In 1973 he gave us his own bluesy tale of yuletide woe.

184354	Sad	184354.jpg	Ernest Tubb & His Texas Troubadours - Lonely Christmas Eve - 1964 Born 1914, in Crisp, Texas, country music legend Ernest Tubb‚Äôs career spanned over four decades and included such classics as ‚ÄúWaltz Across Texas With You?and ‚ÄúWalking the Floor Over You? During that time he also recorded numerous seasonal tunes, including the first hit record version of ‚ÄúBlue Christmas?8 years before it became an even bigger hit for Elvis Presley. In 1964, with his Texas Troubadours, he recorded an entire album of country flavored yuletide cheer. It was a notch or two above the average Christmas album at the time in that many of the songs were original tunes instead of simply lazy remakes of old chestnuts and carols. One of the standout tracks was this tearjerker tale of a very sad Christmas alone. CLICK HERE TO LISTEN:

184357	Sad	184357.jpg	Freddie King - Christmas Tears - 1961 Hailing from Gilmer, Texas and taught to play the guitar by his uncle, as a child, King grew up steeped in the blues. He was 12 when his family left Texas for the South Side of Chicago. Though still underage, he would sneak into the local night clubs to catch the sounds of his soon-to-be idols such as Muddy Waters, Elmore James & Howling?Wolf. As his guitar skill improved he eventually began to sit in with them for jams. By 1953 he had a record deal. He is best known for the hits ‚ÄúHave You Ever Loved a Woman?and ‚ÄúHideaway?(both of which, as well as this song, would later be covered by Eric Clapton). In 1961 he brought us one of the best blues Christmas songs ever. CLICK HERE TO LISTEN:

185702	Sad	185702.jpg	Hello, my name is Baxter. I‚Äôm a very old Boxer dog and love people. At 1am this morning I peed on my dog-sitter‚Äôs poorly foot, soaking her bandages. Luckily, the NHS provides an out-of-hours District Nurse service who changed her dressings with temporary materials. ? Unfortunately this meant she had to journey back to the hospital to get better dressings. She now also has to go back on Wednesday to see her surgeon to make sure there is no infection. ? She knows I‚Äôm very sorry, I couldn‚Äôt help it. We‚Äôve had lots of cuddles and I‚Äôm currently sleeping on the sofa next to her, and we‚Äôre nice and cosy in front of the TV. ? ? ?

In the the last months he has been hanging out with our other old man, Ebony. They spent there days together resting and nibbling veggies. Romeo was a bar chewer. Always excited for you to come see him. He would chew the bars of his cage in anticipation. He fathered some of our babies here. He left us with his son, Sebastian. Romeo was a sweet natured boy, who was a big part of our family. We thought we were losing him a year ago, but he bounced back. This time he could not. It was time to leave us. We did have an extra year together and for that we are grateful. We love you Romeo. You leave us with many happy memories. Run free at the Rainbow Bridge sweet boy. üåàüåà

187003	Sad	187003.jpg	My friend said he thought this part was weird, and this style definitely seems out of place. But I really liked it because it felt like the perfect representation of the phrase ‚Äúmy mind was racing?and just listening to Bojack‚Äôs jumbled train of thoughts. It was like a stream of consciousness. And for me, it‚Äôs almost justification for his shitty behavior. Outside, we see a guy who doesn‚Äôt give a shit about people, but his mind is punishing himself and going through so many other things at the same time. Does knowing you‚Äôre shitty justify your shitty behavior? You could go in a long philosophical discussion about that so I‚Äôm not going to talk about it, but something I do want to bring up that is totally relevant to this topic is what Diane said in season 1 ‚ÄúI kinda think all you are is just the things you do? And she does have a point. If you truly believe something, if you are truly convicted, then you should be compelled to act as if it were true. I think I was glad for this bit because it made me feel a little better for certain things and times where maybe my choices were on the bad side. If you are not just the things you do, that means there is some intangible force controlling us, and I can make the excuse that it‚Äôs not me that made the bad decision. And that‚Äôs my excuse. But is it excusable? That‚Äôs the question. Something to think about is when Todd says tells Bojack ‚ÄúYou are all the things wrong with you? And there definitely is validity in that statement, I think we all should take responsibility for our actions, but?

188770	Sad	188770.jpg	I‚Äôll Lend you a Child I will lend you, for a little time, A child of mine, he said. For you to love the while she lives, And mourn for when she‚Äôs dead. It may be six or seven years, Or twenty-two or three. But will you, till I call her back, Take care of her for Me? She‚Äôll bring her charms to gladden you, And should her stay be brief. You‚Äôll have her lovely memories, As solace for your grief. I cannot promise she will stay, Since all from earth return. But there are lessons taught down there, I want this child to learn. I‚Äôve looked the wide world over, In search for teachers true. And from the throngs that crowd life‚Äôs lanes I have selected you. Now will you give her all your love, Nor think the labour vain. Nor hate me when I come To take her home again? I fancied that I heard them say, ‚ÄòDear Lord, Thy will be done!?For all the joys Thy child shall bring, The risk of grief we‚Äôll run. We‚Äôll shelter her with tenderness, We‚Äôll love her while we may, And for happiness we‚Äôve known, Forever grateful stay. But should the angels call for her, Much sooner than we planned. We‚Äôll brave the bitter grief that comes, And try to understand. by Edgar Guest

190634	Sad	190634.jpg	Moments Away (on Wattpad) They say that time is worth far more than anything in this world. That time is money. Then, how much is a moment worth? Life on earth was perfect, until the sinful and greedy nature of humans took over their weak minds, exchanging the pure thoughts with desires of materialistic. You could have everything, but the word complete would not satisfy their needs. With one turn, the earth turned their backs on the humans that stopped at nothing to fulfill their wants. This left the population in distress as they fought to figure out ways of survival. After all, they do say, survival of the fittest. They‚Äôve done everything to get what they want, what can‚Äôt they do to survive?

Nothing has changed and nothing will ever change, it‚Äôs just how it is. I‚Äôm always going to love you, I just know it.

But those days are over and I need to stop putting myself in a position to be hurt again. I love you so much fucking and i hope one day some lucky girl makes you as happy as you made me.

193387	Sad	193387.jpg	Made this piece during one of my low points. One personal thing about me is that I struggle with depression and am very sensitive to how other people perceive me, probably more than I should. So whenever I feel like I‚Äôve said or done something wrong, it effects me horribly. Even when they‚Äôve pasted and I‚Äôm not thinking about them, all those moments continue to haunt me. I made Dakuwaqa in this piece because he would also be deeply regretful of any bad thing he‚Äôs done. I had another one of those low moments recently and I needed to let it out.

Did we just watch them and sit there doing nothing? Oh God, please save us.

I remember the tears and the pain, and seeing you laying there. You couldn‚Äôt make a sound, you could barely move. Holding you in my arms as you took your last breath, seeing the light leave your eyes, and then feeling you motionless as my tears dropped onto your face. Holding you in your last minutes was so difficult, but I was there with you when you needed me, like you were for me when I needed you. I held you so close and so tight, rubbed your hand as you fell asleep, and I could feel that you were at peace. When you left a piece of me went with you, and I hope you carry it with you always. I love you with every piece of my heart and inch of my soul.

Jamas podria volver a ser una mujer como lo era antes,nunca mas siento yo. Quiero que las chicas piensen que soy lindo, quiero usar boxers, quiero un binder y quiero mis hormonas?Quiero ser un Chico normal, un chico de verdad.

194580	Sad	194580.jpg	At last, here is the next page(s) of the comic. So, to explain that break that just happened between me getting these pages done. As I said, I have moved down to Florida (which was a 3 day drive to begin with) and after being down for a day or two, I then immediately was put to work at my new job and didn‚Äôt have a day off for three more days. All that piled together means that I never really had the time or energy to get any work done over the past week, which is why this took awhile to get out (though it only took me one night to draw this). So onto the drawing itself, I am very happy with how the ship turned out here. Considering I had no real idea what Lucas?ship looked like before this drawing (except that it was a junkier caravel type ship) I am quite pleased that I was able to throw this design together and have it look good. And since I‚Äôm not confident in how easy it is to figure out what James is shouting (to no avail) here, I‚Äôll just say here that he‚Äôs shouting ‚ÄúCome back!!?Anyway, glad I could finally get that done and be one step closer to finally wrapping up this comic. Enjoy.

I learned a lot from life. I learned a lot from staying alive. Trust me when I say, you will one day experience joy that matches this pain. You will cry euphoric tears from the stupid jokes of your friends, you will stare down at the face of a baby as she lies asleep in your lap and you will know the beauty of life, you will make great friends, you will eat delicious food you haven‚Äôt tried yet, you will be able to look at a view from a high place and not assess the likelihood of dying from falling. There are books you haven‚Äôt read yet that will enrich you, films you will watch while eating extra-large buckets of popcorn, and you will dance and laugh and have sex and go for runs by the river and have late-night conversations and laugh until it hurts. Life is waiting for you. You might be stuck here for a while, but the world isn‚Äôt going anywhere. Hang on in there if you can. Life is always worth it. Stay hopeful.
