936	Angry	936.jpg	Women vs - The mission was to create a stereo type that would last through the ages. One that exists even today with help from people like Lee Daniels & Danny Strong During the era of the Jim Crow laws, it was a crime for Blacks to argue with White people, Black women were given a leeway to which was not only supposed to represent their acceptance into White families as “mammies? This stereotype portrays Black women as not only offering help to the White families but it also showcases Black women with anger and masculinity. Many movie producers today keep this stereotype alive in order to influence younger woman that this is how are supposed to act. Tyler Perry for example: He showcases himself as a Black woman, Madea. Madea is portrayed as a big, black, strong, hostile and sometimes illogical woman who has the tendency to overreact with force and violence when she has been wronged or wants to defend herself. She is also portrayed as extremely nurturing and cares a lot about the well-being of children and teenagers but never hesitant to “lash out?on them anytime they showed signs of disrespect. She involves herself in the situations of others, giving them advice and offering self-defense tips or methods of vengeance when needed. Moreover, her hospitality is overridden by her comical aggressiveness demonstrated more to the audience which adds to the false depiction of Black women. On the other hand, Lee Daniels and Danny Strong’s television show, Empire, is another example of the stereotype of the trope of angry Black woman. In fact, one of the main characters, Cookie Lyon is an embodiment of the stereotype Black women face in the film. This show represents a tough motherly figure who was born and raised in the “hood?around drug dealers and gangs. She served 17 years in prison, away from her children and did not get to watch them grow up. She along with her husband, Lucious Lyons, were fortunate enough to form a company known as Empire, which took them from rags to riches. The elegance can be seen through what she wears with knee-high boots, fashionable fur coats, long color-coded nails, but her short temper and violent tendencies tend to overshadow her good. Black women continue to be affected by this stereotype, in the sense that people who have been conditioned to view African American women as angry Black women, respond to Black women’s emotions with fear. With this trope as one of the biggest topics and issues in Black film, and the lack of diversity of Black women in film which can leave an impression on the audience that Black women are all always angry. We must set aside these stereotypes and Black Women today need to grab hold instead of the qualities that our Father in heaven declares are righteous. Learn more about Proverbs31 by reading the book: by acclaimed Author Bachir Yisra’el. - Other Examples are found here: Sapphire, a character in Amos ‘n?Andy Aunt Esther, a character in Sanford and Son Bernadette, a character in Waiting to Exhale, performed by actress Angela Bassett Madea Simmons, character in Diary of a Mad Black Woman and other Tyler Perry plays and films 'Crazy Bitch?from The Boondocks Wilhelmina Slater, a character in Ugly Betty Rasputia, an obese and overbearing woman in the 2007 Eddie Murphy comedy Norbit Lakatriona Brunson from South Beach Tow Cookie from Empire Rochelle from Everybody Hates Chris

Ranting and complaining to others is common. For the person they are mad at get ready for criticism and if you are close to them a lecture/scolding. They express themselves honestly and there wont be a filter BUT they normally don’t try to be mean on purpose. They get over things once they think them over a million times and can express themselves.

You don’t have to condone someone’s actions or pretend you’re okay with them in order to be a good or spiritual person. Just know that you have the power to move beyond your pain when you’re ready. You have the power to find lessons in your heartache, gains in your losses, and reasons to forgive. It might take time, and it might not be easy, but it is possible to heal and move on. - Lori Deschene - To Read More ?

65291	Fear	65291.jpg	Never let the fear cripple you! The risk of FAIL should never conquer the chance of GAIN. Look at it like this…‪If you were in a shootout in the Wild West…In a duel with one other person, there’s a chance he gets off first and you get shot by your foe, worst case scenario. But there’s a chance you shoot them first, so my question is this…would the fear from getting shot first stop you from pulling the trigger on them? When you’re prepared, practiced, and know your tools you always stand a chance. And you know me, when I go out, I'mma go out shooting! F*ck That!

66657	Fear	66657.jpg	No matter what situation we find ourselves in, if its even remotely stressful in any way, or possibly could be stressful, anxiety will take that and run with it. We have to be constantly on our game to either head off anxiety before it starts or minimize its effect on us once it begins to try to assert it’s power. One of the things that anxiety is so good at it, is being versatile. By constantly changing its tactics on the fly, we have to stay vigilant on our own behalf and fight this battle against a relentless foe. Make no mistake though, friends, anxiety is not unbeatable! If you remember back to a previous trick we talked about in this series, anxiety wants us to think that every situation is going to turn out awful, and be the worst thing we have ever experienced. Which brings us to the next trick, an off shoot of that tactic is that anxiety also wants us to live in fear. Living in fear is no way to live if we want to have a peaceful, happy, life full of contentment. Anxiety loves nothing more than to not allow that to happen, and it will try to use fear to its advantage. That’s one thing about anxiety, it pulls no punches and leaves no stone unturned; no tactic is off the table. Fear in itself is not a bad thing, we are all born with this healthy instinct. It’s there to alert us of danger and to help keep us safe. If we happen to come up on a wild animal while going out on a walk, fear will cause to keep our distance. If there is unsafe part of town that is known to be dangerous at night, fear (and good common sense) keeps us from going there. Read more on the blog -

67862	Fear	67862.jpg	The problem is that when you procrastinate it’s because you are fearing the outcome of anything good. This is how you sabatoge your success. Mentally you won’t allow yourself to do an excellent job. How to stop? You must start consistently breaking the pattern. You’ve done this before. Visualize yourself DOING IT first and then take every means possible to achieve what you want. Every means. Write it down and create a checklist. You can do this. (at Fort Lauderdale, Florida)	
67961	Fear	67961.jpg	You know that feeling when there’s a mosquito somewhere in your room, but you can’t find it? That’s how it feels like to live with military drones over your head ?if the mosquitoes also carried nearly 4,000 pounds of explosives, and had the judgment and restraint of a sleep-deprived soldier locked inside a tiny fart-box for a few days. “The first off-putting thing about Waziristan was a constant, inescapable buzzing,?Muhammad recalls. “It was an annoying noise emitted by the drones scouting the area for terrorists to kill. It’s a constant, low buzz, almost a hum, so subtle yet so present that it has become Waziristan’s status quo, its not so silent silence. You eventually get used to it, but I sure was glad I spent my first two days in Miranshah’s [the administrative headquarters of North Waziristan] only sound-proof hotel.? Eventually, you get used to the noise ?but that has its own issues. Muhammad explains: “When the natives would come home from a trip to the mainland, they’d talk about how the actual silence they experienced there was deafening. They experience pain when they hear true silence for the first time ?The humming carries along with them everywhere they go. In Waziristan, they never experience the purity of their surroundings, because they are constantly taking in the humming of drones.? 4 Facts Of Life In A Town That’s Constantly Bombed By Drones

72861	Fear	72861.jpg	Sometimes it’s not the others to fear, but oneself. How can one really feel safe..when they are the cause of their own destruction? People hurt people, yes, people make others feel like there’s nothing in their life, but the emotional scars often cause physical as well. Many don’t understand how much a simple comment can hurt someone. People don’t know how close one is, how much it will take to push them over the edge. Unfortunately, there are people out there with that goal. You just have to remember that there’s also people out there with the goal of keeping YOU safe. It may not seem like it (and I know many of you are going to disregard this comment because I have been/am in a similar position), but there are people who don’t want you to go. People who need you in their life. People who, without you, won’t be the person they need to be. It doesn’t matter who you are. YOU. ARE. LOVED. Please, darling, never forget that.

77653	Fear	77653.jpg	La nostra più grande paura non è quella di essere inadeguati, la nostra più grande paura è quella di essere potenti al di là di ogni misura, è la nostra luce non la nostra oscurità che più ci spaventa. Agire da piccolo uomo non aiuta il mondo non c'è nulla di illuminante nel rinchiudersi in sé stessi così che le persone intorno a noi si sentiranno insicure. Noi siamo nati per rendere manifesta la gloria che c'è dentro di noi, non è solo in alcuni di noi è in tutti noi se noi lasciamo la nostra luce splendere inconsciamente diamo alle altre persone il permesso di fare lo stesso, appena ci liberiamo dalla nostra paura, la nostra presenza automaticamente libera gli altri. (Timo Cruz) (presso Modena, Italy)	
77676	Fear	77676.jpg	Why do we try so hard to hold on to relationships that are clearly dead? At the time, I thought I did so out of love and loyalty. Now, I realize that it was because of fear.

77779	Fear	77779.jpg	HOW CAN WE BE SO RELATED, YET WE HAVE NO RELATIONSHIP? This happens a lot where you have members of the same Family through blood, have no relationship with themselves. As long as we get used to it from the homes we come from, it becomes very easy for us to meet with Jesus Christ, Accept Him as our Personal Lord and Saviour, and yet have no relationship with Him, but assume we do because we offer spiritual sacrifices alongside other members of our religious community. Maybe it’s time we started asking ourselves very important questions like “If I dont do what Jesus is asking of me, what is the base of our relationship??If I dont even know what’s on His Mind, because I don’t read His Word, Meditate on it, and commit myself to His Will for me, what is my proof of being related to Him? I pray we will not be told DEPART FROM ME O EVIL DOER, FOR I DO NOT KNOW YOU at the end of our lives here on Earth. Amen.

78199	Fear	78199.jpg	- Seeing yourself yell at your kids? If you do, don’t guilt yourself and this is not about shaming oneself. In fact, parenting for the most part is about containing our own frustrations and aggressive tendencies. So give yourself a break. Though just because you don’t hit your kids, doesn’t mean yelling at them doesn’t kick their psychological defence mechanisms into high gear. Try…just try…to speak to them gently and kindly, …and point out how their behaviour upsets you and that they are telling you they are not feeling okay. Don’t just observe their behaviour, observe how their feelings are like behind the behaviour. The Psychology Practice (at Asia/Singapore)

I’m so concerned that I am consistently eating over my meal plan and being gluttonous and gaining weight as a result. Balance is so so hard, as is flexibility. Freedom is terrifying, and I want to run back to the controlled cage of the eating disorder. But that would be actively choosing the ED, and I don’t know if I could live with myself for that. I know I’m moving forward, but it feels so slow, and sometimes it feels like dying. I don’t know. I just want to be relapsing or Recovered, and this endless in between sucks.	
82330	Fear	82330.jpg	Did you know that is actually OKAY to have fears or a lack of confidence? But, to get around the fear, you first have to investigate these questions.

84849	Fear	84849.jpg	?Jump! It was a lovely day, I wanted to take this quote from Steven Aitchison: ‘Right now you may not be where you intended to be but it’s where you need to be in order to get where you want to go? Summer to us has a different story and I believe whoever read this blog right now I know there’s something great behind your summer. This my first time to do cliff diving, it’s not to high kunbaga sakto lan for a first timer, nakasuot pa ako ng life jacket but when I got to jump na tinanggal ko ito because I felt uncomfortable with it, when I looked down, nakaramdam ako ng takot. Yung takot ba na naramdaman ko, is it fear that give me courage to jump? or fear na hindi ko na ituloy? Gladly, I made it! Somehow, we all have fears, fears that made us or broke us. Whenever we feel afraid, jump. Even though you may fail or you may get hurt, still, jump. Mali yung pagtalon ko, sumakit yung mga binti ko but at the end of the day I felt it was fulfilling because I made it! In our life, there’s always a situation to make us jump, jump so that you can overcome your fear, you will not know where it would lead you but I promise that it can help you grow, jump with courage. Every time I jump, I feel more exciting and here I come giving my whole self to the universe as I go where the Lord leads me to go, sunod lan sa Lord because it’s always a blessing from the Lord for giving us opportunity to travel and to do stuff like this. Have a great day!	
84877	Fear	84877.jpg	The greatest fear in the world is of the opinions of other, and the moment you are unafraid of the crowd, you are no longer a sheep, you become a lion. A great roar arises in you heart, the roar of freedom. ?Osho [Chandra Mohan Jain]

105856	Happy	105856.jpg	so, we did it. i just came back to this blog (after suffering a case of finding myself and loving it) in order to get my thoughts back to that creative space outside of my mind. you know how it goes when life distracts you from living? yeah. anyway, i forgot that i really liked the format i chose. it surprised me that i had dropped writing on this platform, yet it confirmed how lost inside the lemons of life i’d gotten?especially when i saw the first one?and then the fourth (or whatever number of re-blogs after). i. was. depressed. af. i wanted love so badly. i risked my life for it. literally in all ways. times like these bring me closer to myself, fortunately. because once i finally realized the person i am is exactly the person i thought i was, i made lemonade out of those lemons. (and of course that’s such a cheesy cliche, but it fits, so whatever.) ? darius and i got married on october 18, 2016 and it was one of the happiest days of my life. i’d finally gotten what my entire life had been governed by: a partner. a forever thing. s e c u r i t y. i used to joke with him (in whatever serious capacity a joke could be taken) about not wanting to be bothered on our wedding day. it was to be a day that was free from my anxious mind running amok - no questions, no wondering, no assumptions of bad intent. and that’s exactly what he gave me. even though i developed a serious migraine (which ended up being the start of a biyearly sinus infection), darius gave me a dream day. he took into account everything and handled it before it had a chance to bother me. nothing seemed like it could bother us that day. and after hiccup after hiccup after hiccup after hiccup after hiccup, we’ve successfully gotten right back to that bliss? (we’ll get into the hiccups later)

125478	Happy	125478.jpg	Considering where our city is today I did not expect to be inspired the way I was when by some quirk of fate I got a chance to visit Raj Bhavin, the Governor’s estate at Walkeshwar earlier this week. We truly felt like guests as we were escorted around the estate by the warm and courteous Raj Bhavan team. The estate itself is sprawled over 46 acres and by their records has over 3000 different trees. There were several peacocks and many varieties of birds. And everything is immaculately maintained. As we sat at the sunrise point and experienced the sunrise we were mesmerised by the stunning scene that unfolded. That entire moment and the estate truly showed us what Mumbai was like in the past and honestly what it’s potential is. This was that moment of inspiration. We as Mumbaikars can expect to get our city back and drive the powers that be to revive and recreate the city the way it was. G & I chose to walk around and take in the green experience. This was truly invigorating despite the summer heat. It is very special to be ensconced in greenery within the city. This little forest in the heart of the city lifted our spirits. Getting up at 4.30, showering and reaching the Raj Bhavan gate 5.45 am was quite a challenge. But in hindsight I am really glad that we did it. The experience was truly surreal and inspiring. (at Raj Bhavan (Mumbai))

135328	Happy	135328.jpg	Chocolate 🍫 Coconut Energy Balls⠀ .⠀ 1 cup natural nut butter, smooth or creamy (I used peanut butter)⠀ 2-3 T. honey⠀ 2 cups unsweetened coconut flakes⠀ 1 ½ cups MorelliFit Grass-Fed Whey Protein Isolate⠀ 2 T. chia seeds⠀ 3-6 T. water⠀ .⠀ Heat nut butter and honey for 30 seconds in the microwave and stir. Add all other ingredients and mix everything together. You want them to stick together so you can roll them into balls. You can add more water to adjust the texture. ⠀ .⠀ Roll them into balls. Place them on a parchment paper-covered cookie sheet or platter. Then put them in the fridge for at least an hour to set. I store them in the fridge too.⠀ .⠀ These are great on the go, muscle-building post-workout or delicious for those times when you’re craving chocolate! ⠀ .⠀ .⠀ .⠀ .⠀ .⠀ .⠀ (at Bolivar, Missouri)

149493	Love	149493.jpg	“Любов??вот еще одна причина, по которой я верую. Что имеет значение в конце жизни, кроме нее? «Любовь никогда не перестает, ?сказал Павел. ?[Она] все покрывает, всему верит, всего надеется, все переносит». Павел мог описывать только Божью любовь, потому что никакая человеческая любовь не соответствует этому стандарту совершенства. То, что я на своем опыте узнал о любви, убеждает меня, что совершенная любовь никогда не будет удовлетворена печальной историей этой планеты. Она не успокоится, пока не будет побеждено зло и не воцарится добро. Она не позволит своему объекту прекратить существование. Совершенная любовь упорно трудится до тех пор, пока не доведет все до совершенства.? «Дневник Благодати». Филип Янси (at Tumwater Historical Park)

151309	Love	151309.jpg	I loved the saying in the post. Is true, I have spent countless hours/moments with people that matter to me.💖 That’s living!😊 ??? “I would like to remember my long, long, long walk home along familiar country roads over, along, down, up, left, down, across the river, along, beneath two bridges, and to. All beneath the bright white moon. Arriving at the gardener’s farmhouse, I go upstairs to my attic room, meditate, and I work. Finally I fall asleep, fast and deep.🔸None of this may mean a thing, and you are nervous, and you want space. It may mean something, and I am not nervous, and I will give you all the space you need. For love if true is caring about another’s heart, not merely one’s own.?~ 🔸 Get the book: elephantjournal.com/shop (or click the link in bio 👆🏻) ❤?	
151335	Love	151335.jpg	Кокосовое масло. 🌴🌴🌴🌴🌴🌴 Одно из самых популярных сегодня ?масло кокоса. Его привозят из Таиланда, Индонезии и других жарких стран. Применяют внутренне и наружно, делают маски для волос и используют вместо крема, приписывая этой субстанции самые невероятные свойства. Адепты кокосового масла уверяют, что оно разглаживает морщины, придает коже упругость, восстанавливает поврежденные волосы, способствует похудению и т.д. Давайте разберемся, где правда, а где ?вымысел. Кокосовое масло состоит из ненасыщенных жирных кислот, которые сходны с липидами нашей кожи. Именно поэтому оно идеально восстанавливает гидролипидную пленку ?защитный барьер кожи, попутно делая ее мягкой, шелковистой и гладкой. Действие масла чисто механическое и поверхностное. Оно не проникает в клетки, не может повлиять на их работу и каким-либо образом остановить старение. Кокосовое масло, как и все растительные масла, ?это нелетучее органическое вещество. Его способность «удерживать влагу» (хотя на самом деле оно ее не удерживает, а отталкивает) объясняется гидрофобными свойствами. Поэтому правильнее всего наносить масло на влажную кожу после душа, а затем промакивать полотенцем. Так субстанция как бы запечатает влагу, не давая ей испариться. Если у вас очень сухая шелушащаяся кожа, можно дважды в неделю делать маски для тела с применением кокосового масла. Для этого после душа нужно сначала нанести увлажняющий крем с гиалуроновой кислотой (она проникает внутрь клеток, куда никакое масло не доберется), сверху щедрым слоем нанести кокосовое масло и для усиления эффекта обернуть пленкой. Такие маски отлично подходят для заживления трещинок на пятках, коленях, локтях и других огрубевших участках тела. (at Planet Earth)

151509	Love	151509.jpg	on READER QUESTIONS: I DON’T THINK MY HUSBAND LOVES ME AND I AM MISERABLE. WHAT DO I DO? Perhaps you are like Victoria (name has been changed), and you feel that you are in a loveless marriage. I hope this advice I gave to her will help you to fight for your marriage, and trust God to make a way, where there seems no way. ********** Dear Vicky, I am sad to hear about the state of affairs in your marriage. But I am glad that you are a Christian and you believe in God. It means that there is hope in restoring love in your marriage. The truth is though the marriage wasn’t entered into with wisdom, God still loves you and God still honours your marriage. If you honour Him and obey Him, trust Him and depend on Him, listen to His guidance and submit to His will, He can do wonders in your marriage, in your life and with your husband. Having read An Emotional Affair, you should know that there is nothing impossible for God to do. We have to believe, trust and obey. Now, it is going to be hard to keep doing the right thing in your marriage. Especially when you’re not getting positive feedback, affirmation, love and understanding from your spouse?

151650	Love	151650.jpg	About a month ago, I’m waiting for a medical test when the nurse walks out and starts grinning from ear to ear as she says hello to a woman in the room. They exchange greetings, and then the nurse looks down at the piece of paper in her hand and calls out the next victim’s, I mean patient’s name, which is mine. I look over my shoulder as I walk through the door with her and say, “See you soon, Mom.? The nurse suddenly realizes the woman she’d been so happy to see is with me. “That’s your Mom?!??she exclaims, eyes wide. I grin. “Yep.? She smiles again. “Oh, she’s SO beautiful.? I chuckle. “Yeah,?I nod. The nurse’s brow weaves together. “Oh, you’re beautiful, too,?she adds quickly. I laugh as she begins telling me why she thinks my mom is so special and beautiful, and quickly I figure out that though she may have only met my mom a handful of times over the years, she knows what most people know…Mom is beautiful inside and out, and that my friends, really is something. Here’s a little birthday card I wrote for the mothership. If you see Jacquelyn, give her a hug? She prays without end She’s always a friend, She falls, she gets up She tries again She explores, she sees, She hikes, she believes She gardens, she listens She inspires, she sings She’s sugar and spice, She laughs till she cries She gives everything, She dares you to dream True beauty, the real deal Authentic, naturally, She’s a helper, she’s a fighter She’s there for you and me. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MOM! I love you. Love your favorite pain, (AKA the middle child), Sarah xoxoxo

152909	Love	152909.jpg	Несколько долгих месяцев увлечен просмотром отлично скроенного👍 сериала “Безумцы? снятого относительно недавно. В нем показан Нью-Йорк 1960-х годов.В центре внимания вымышленное рекламное агентство “Стерлинга-Купера?и его креативный директор - мастер манипуляции и интриг - Дон Дрейпер.События разворачиваются в мире рекламы, где царит неординарность, гламур и эгоцентризм.Каждый из героев истории пытается провернуть свою операцию по купле-продаже, вот только, товар не всегда обладает надлежащим видом.То есть, он представлен в одном свете, а в реальности, совсем другой, менее качественный. Восхищают - сценография, костюмы и реквизит ?они безусловно исторически точно. Все это вкупе заставляет смотреть сериал на одном дыхании! Из увиденного? (at Barneys New York, Madison Avenue)	
152986	Love	152986.jpg	Todo lo que necesitas es amor. Aunque suene tonto o como una frase vaga. A quien te diga que el amor no es suficiente, no lo escuches. Recuerda que el amor completa. Es el amor el que enseña que todo es posible. Pone en orden al mundo y da sentido a la existencia. Es la razón más noble, sincera y desinteresada por la cual hacer algo. Y ese algo, por el simple hecho de ir acompañado de amor termina siendo bueno. - Joone

159107	Love	159107.jpg	Почему нужно любить себя. 🎀🎀🎀🌸🎀🎀🎀 Три простых упражнения, которые помогут изменить жизнь к лучшему. Не так давно американские психологи открыли интересную закономерность: боязнь сказать окружающим о том, что вы гордитесь своими достижениями может сильно затормозить ваше продвижение по карьерной лестнице. Обычно такое поведение спровоцировано низкой самооценкой, особенно если вам кажется, будто все ваши успехи случились исключительно из-за удачного стечения обстоятельств, а не потому, что вы профессионал своего дела. Чтобы проработать эту проблему, психологи предлагают несколько несложных упражнений, которые помогут полностью изменить вашу жизнь. Прежде всего, нужно определить, откуда у вас появилась привычка стесняться своих достижений. Возьмите старые фотографии родителей и посмотрите, как они ведут себя на этих снимках. Вспомните, часто ли они гордились собой и говорили о том, каких успехов добились, или наоборот старались держаться в тени? Как они относились к вашим достижениям? Как часто вас поощряли за полученные в школе пятерки? Психологи считают, что ответы на эти вопросы помогут понять, продолжаете ли вы придерживаться модели поведения своих родственников. И если да, то дадут возможность определить, с какими из детских установок стоит распрощаться навсегда. (at Planet Earth)

I was listening to songs which brought back so many memories of my childhood and the people I love more than words can say. I was filled with love and longing and memories so wonderful that I couldn’t contain the tears, so I let them fall. My eyes are sore and I’m worn out, I feel a little sad but I’m thankful for the tears, I’m thankful for memories so pure and full of love that they bring me to tears. I’m thankful that I have a husband who doesn’t mind being woken up because I can’t stop crying and I need a cuddle. Now I rest, I stitch, I watch Call The Midwife and hold on to those memories. ❤️

177689	Sad	177689.jpg	Today marks my 1 year,this picture is all I have to show for it, it the only one I got to take. I remember being told ?don’t get your hopes up.? but I noticed a bump, that gave me hope. A few days later I was sitting lounging on the couch I tried to ignore the pain that felt like an oncoming endo attack. I did my best to sing to you and read you Dr suess and let myself think it was a normal pregnancy thing. The pain started to get worse and I could feel the blood running down my legs and I still told myself ?Kenzie ignore it everything is fine you’ve felt worse pain?But then there i was doubled over on the floor screaming for someone to save me I remember my dad telling me it’d be ok and his hands brushing through my hair, then eventually being told they had to do an emergency removal and I had been given 2 pints of blood. I just felt empty, you were the one thing that had given me hope I was so convinced that I was going to show a small portion of the world that good amazing things can come from evil people and that I’d get to show you how damn lucky and thankful I was to be your mom. But then I just get sent home with nothing, but pain, heartbreak, smashed dreams and goals I’d never get to achieve. I remember not understanding why (and I still don’t) I left an abusive relationship for you and I recorded myself reading Dr suess because my goal was go train you to be able to stop crying when being completely lost on what to do so I figured and had hoped that by recording my voice reading and playing it for you while in the womb,that when you came into this world and just needed to know it’s ok reading would do the trick. The last few months I have often wondered would I be changing you, feeding you, watching you sleep, how much youd of grown and the milestones you’d of been making, but I’m just missing you and sad that I never got the chance to hold you or name you and be the mom you deserved.

190071	Sad	190071.jpg	I once read a quote, something along the lines of, “I never knew the first man to break my heart would be my father.?It rings so true for me. I’m terrified of him. I dread seeing him. He has repeatedly hurt me, and I still love him. It’s hard not too. But love that is not reciprocated, can’t mend my broken heart. I honestly can count the amount of times he has told me he loves me, on one hand. It makes me sad, knowing one day, I will never speak to him again. I will eventually grow tired of the abuse. They says girls marry men that are like their fathers. My mother has told me this many times. She has told me I will be lucky if I marry a man like my father. I hope I never meet a man like my father.
